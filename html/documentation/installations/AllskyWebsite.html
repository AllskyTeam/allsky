This page describes how to install and upgrade the Allsky Website.
It can be installed on your Pi, on a remote server, or on both.
When installing on both, install on your Pi first and make sure everything works,
then install on the remote server.
</p>
<p>
Make sure you have Allsky configured and working the way you want it
since some of its settings are also used by the Website
and you don't want to have to change them twice.
</p>

<h2>Install on a Pi</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
If you have an <b>existing</b> Allsky Website on your Pi,
see the section below, otherwise
skip to the <a href="#installation-local">Installing the Website</a> section.
</p>

<h4>Steps for existing Websites</h4>
<p>
The location of the prior website depends upon its version.
In both cases the directory name is <span class="fileName">allsky</span>.
The parent directory is:
<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li><span class="fileName">/var/www/html</span> for Website version <b>v2022.03.01+</b> or before.
	<li><span class="fileName">~/allsky/html</span> for newer versions.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Perform one of the steps below,
then continue to the <a href="#installation-local">Installing the Website</a> section:
<ol>
<li><b>Upgrade the old version.</b>
	<br>
	The Website installation checks for an old version in the locations above,
	and if found, prompts if you want to upgrade it.
	You don't need to do anything special.

<li><b>Save the old version but don't use it.</b>
	<br>
	<pre>
cd <i>old_version_parent_directory</i>     <span class="shellComment"># One of the locations above</span>
mv allsky allsky-SAVED</pre>
	At some point you'll want to delete the SAVED version so it doesn't take disk space.

<li><b>Delete the old version.</b>
	<br>
	Only select this option if you're sure you don't want any saved
	images, videos, keograms, startrails, or settings files.
<pre>
cd <i>old_version_parent_directory</i>     <span class="shellComment"># One of the locations above</span>
rm -fr allsky</pre>
</ol>
</p>


<h4 id="installation-local">Installing the Website</h4>
<p>
Run the following to install the Website on your Pi:
</p>
<pre>
cd ~/allsky
website/install.sh</pre>

<p>
The installation won't prompt for anything, and will display minimal output.
</p>

<p>
After installation do the following:
<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li>Update the <span class="fileName">config.sh</span> file
		via the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> page so Allsky knows which files
		to copy to the Website (e.g., startrails, timelapse, etc.).
	<li>Update the <span class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span> file
		via the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> page so Allsky knows
		where to copy the files to.
</ul>

<h2>Install on a remote server</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Most people have their Pi behind a firewall where it's not accessible on the Internet,
so they install the Allsky Website on a different
machine that <u>is</u> accessible on the Internet.
<blockquote>
If you want to make your Pi available on the Internet, see
<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/host-a-raspberry-pi-web-server-on-the-internet-89786287db77">these instructions</a>.
<br>
<strong>Be careful if you do this - if done incorrectly your Pi may be insecure.</strong>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Prior to installing the Website on a remote server,
make sure Allsky is working on your Pi, then do the following:
<ol>
<li>On the remote server:
	<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li>Create an <span class="fileName">allsky</span> directory to hold the Website.
		<strong>Keep track of where on your server you created the directory</strong>
		- you will need that information later when you tell Allsky where to upload the images.
	</ul>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky-website">allsky-website GitHub page</a>.
<li>Click the <img allsky="true" src="Code.png" alt="Code" class="buttonIcon" loading="lazy">
	button, download the <span class="fileName">allsky-website-master</span> zip file and
	unzip it to a location on your PC, Pi, or Mac.
<li>Upload the <b>contents</b> of the <span class="fileName">allsky-website-master</span> directory
	(but not the directory itself) to the
	<span class="fileName">allsky</span> directory on the remote server.
<li>Do <b>not</b> configure the Website yet - you'll do that below.
<li>On the Pi:
	<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li>Update the <span class="fileName">config.sh</span> file
		via the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> page so Allsky knows which files
		to upload (e.g., startrails, timelapse, etc.).
	<li>Update the <span class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span> file
		via the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> page so Allsky knows
		where on the remote server to upload the files to.
	<li>Run <code>cd ~/allsky;  website/install.sh --remote</code>.
		This will upload a default configuration file to your server,
		leaving the master copy on the Pi.
		<ul>
		<li>If the upload fails, see the
			<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/troubleshooting/uploads.html">Troubleshooting uploads</a>
			page on how to debug the problem.
		<li>If you also have an Allsky Website on your Pi,
			the remote configuration file will be identical to the local one with the
			exception of the <span class="editorSetting">imageName</span> and
			<span class="editorSetting">onPi</span> settings,
			which will be configured for a remote Website.
			<br>
			If you want the remote configuration to differ from the local one
			(for example, to add a background image to the remote Website),
			edit the remote configuration file - see the next step.
		</ul>
	<li>Configure the remote Website:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
			<li>In the WebUI, click on the <span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> link.
			<li>In the drop-down at the bottom of the page, select
				<code class="noWrap">remote_configuration.json (remote Allsky Website).</code>
			<li>See
				<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/settings/allskyWebsite.html">this page</a>
				for details on the Website settings.
		</ul>
		<blockquote class="warning">
		Whenever you update the remote Website's configuration you <strong>must</strong>
		do so via WebUI (follow the first two steps above).
		Do NOT edit the configuration file directly on the remote server.
		</blockquote>
	</ul>
<li>Your remote server is now ready.
<li>Give your family and friends the URL to your Allsky Website so they can enjoy your images!
</ol>


<h3>Remote Website Requirements</h3>
The remote server needs to support the following:
<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li>PHP version 7 or newer.
	<li>The <code>imagecreatefromjpeg</code> function in PHP to create thumbnails
		of the startrails and keogram files.
		If that function does not exist (which is rare),
		you'll see a thumbnail that says "No thumbnail".
		Everything else will still work.
	<li>The <code>ffmpeg</code> command and <code>exec</code> function in PHP
		to create thumbnails of the timelapse videos.
		<blockquote>
		Most hosting solutions don't support those commands for security reasons.
		In that case, set <span class="shSetting">TIMELAPSE_UPLOAD_THUMBNAIL</span> to "true"
		(and <span class="shSetting">TIMELAPSE_MINI_UPLOAD_THUMBNAIL</span> to "true"
		if you are creating mini timelapses) in <span class="fileName">config.sh</span>.
		Failure to set those variables will result in "No thumbnail" messages when
		viewing videos.
		Everything else will still work.
		</blockquote>
</ul>

<h2>Post installation - local and remote</h2>
<p>
Change
<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/settings/allskyWebsite.html">Allsky Website Settings</a>
as desired so the Website looks and behaves like you want it to.
Changes to both local Websites and remote Websites are both done via the WebUI.
</p>

<blockquote>
If your prior version of the Allsky Website was in
<span class="fileName">/var/www/html/allsky</span>
note that there is only one configuration file in the new Website
(<span class="fileName">configuration.json</span>)
that replaces the two older files.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
If you have both a local and a remote Website,
they each have their own configuration file which is
accessible via the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> page.
They are NOT automatically kept in sync so if you change something, for example,
the lens, you'll need to change it in both files.
