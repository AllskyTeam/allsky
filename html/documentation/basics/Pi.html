<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
This page is for people with little or no Pi experience.
To keep the other Allsky documentation pages a manageable length,
they assume you have basic Pi knowledge.
For example, you know how to turn a Pi on and off and how to connect a camera to it.
</p>

<h3>Operating Systems</h3>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
The Linux operating system controls the Pi's hardware and lets you run software
such as Allsky.
The two most common versions of Linux for the Pi are <b>Buster</b>,
which was released several years ago,
and <b>Bullseye</b> which was released late 2021. <b>Bookworm</b> was released with the launch of the Pi 5. 
Allsky runs on all three operating systems but use <b>Bookworm</b> 64bit if possible,
especially if you have an RPi camera.
Allsky works on both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Bullseye and Bookworm;
there was no official 64-bit version of Buster and Allsky is not supported on it.
</p>
<p>
There are different distributions of Linux (called "distros") from various companies.
While they are basically the same Linux,
there can be subtle differences and the administrative commands can vary.
</p>
<blockquote>
The recommended Linux distro is <b>Debian</b>.
We can't guarantee Allsky will run on other distros.
</blockquote>

<h3>Raspberry Pi Models</h3>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
There are several models of the Pi including Zero, Zero 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and others.
The Pi 3 and 4 are the most common being used for Allsky,
but some people have the Pi Zero or Zero 2 because of their low cost.
The various models have different processing power;
the Pi 5 is the most powerful, followed by the 4, then 3, then 2, then 1.
The Zero 2 is near the Pi 3 in terms of processing power but has less memory.
The Pi 4 is available with up to 8 GB memory whereas the
Pi Zero and Zero 2 are limited to 0.5 GB memory.
The Pi 5 is the latest version and is supported as of v2023.05.01_04 release.
Although Allsky can run on the Zero 2, several GB of swap space are needed,
and even then, Allsky just barely runs.
The processing power of the Pi Zero is very limited so you likely won't
be able to create timelapse videos - stay away from it if possible.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The recommended unit is a Pi 4 or 5 with 4 GB or more of memory.</strong>
Allsky runs nicely on that and the USB 3.0 ports are nice for cameras that support it.
</p>
</details>

<h3>Hardware Overview</h3>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Newer devices come with USB 2 ports and the Pi 4 and 5 both have two USB 3 ports.
They also have a special port to plug RPi and compatible cameras into.
</p>
