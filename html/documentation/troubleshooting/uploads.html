<b>Uploading</b> a file is the act of copying it to a different computer.
Allsky supports several ways to upload files, typically to a remote Allsky Website:
<code>ftp</code>, <code>scp</code>, and others.
Uploads can fail for many reasons.
The most common ones are described below, as well as their fixes.
</p>

<h2>Uploads using FTP/SFTP fail</h2>
<p>
The most common causes of FTP/SFTP failures are:
</p>

<h3>Incorrect settings</h3>
<details><summary></summary>
<blockquote>
Most people use <code>ftp</code> or <code>sftp</code> to transfer files to another machine,
so this section will assume that.
The term "remote website" means a website not on your Pi,
but on a remote server, possibly one you pay for services on.
</blockquote>
<p>
The <span class="shSetting">REMOTE_HOST</span>,
<span class="shSetting">REMOTE_USER</span>,
and <span class="shSetting">REMOTE_PASSWORD</span>
settings in <span class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span> must be correct.
If you can't log into to your remote server with that information, Allsky won't be able to either.
 Single quotes in the password can cause a problem for Allsky.
</p>
<p>
The values you entered into <span class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span> like
<span class="shSetting">IMAGE_DIR</span> and <span class="shSetting">KEOGRAM_DIR</span>
must match the directory structure on your FTP server.
</p>

<blockquote>
The concept of mapping URLs to file locations on a server is very important,
but not very intuitive to most people.
You may need to read this section multiple times.
</blockquote>
<p>
When you enter a URL into a browser, how does the server know where the file is?
It typically starts looking in the root of the website,
which is usually specified by the web server administrator.
When you go to the Allsky WebUI, for example via <b>http://allsky</b>,
Allsky looks in <span class="fileName">/home/pi/allsky/html</span>
since that's what the Allsky developers specified.
</p>
<p>As you can see, there are two paths to the file - one via a URL and another
via the filesystem on the machine.
The web server software maps a URL to a file on a computer.
Sometimes that mapping is easy, and other times it's more difficult.
In both cases, it impacts what you enter into the settings in
<span class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span>.
</p>

<h4>Easy case - URL matches server directory structure</h4>
<p>
Let's say you have a remote website at <b>https://mysite.com</b>
and you store family photos there.
When you FTP into your server you see the family photos.
This means your website URL is also the top-most directory of your remote
server's directory structure, called the "root" 
or <span class="fileName">/</span> directory.
</p>
<p>
Per Allsky's recommendations, you create a directory in the root of the remote server called
<span class="fileName">allsky</span> using your FTP client,
and copy all the files from the Allsky Website to that directory.
(See the
<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/installations/AllskyWebsite.html">Allsky Website Installation</a>
instructions for more details).
The URL to your Allsky Website would be <b>https://mysite.com/allsky</b>.
In <span class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span> you would set
<span class="shSetting">IMAGE_DIR</span>="<span class="editorString">/allsky</span>"
(or <span class="shSetting">IMAGE_DIR</span>="<span class="editorString">allsky</span>",
depending on your service provider).
You would also have
<span class="shSetting">KEOGRAM_DIR</span>="<span class="editorString">/allsky/keogram</span>",
and so on.
</p>


<h4>More difficult case - URL does not match directory structure</h4>
<p>
You have the same website URL as above,
but when you FTP into your server you don't see the photos;
instead, you see a directory with the same name as your user name,
for example, <span class="fileName">myusername</span>
(the actual directory(s) you see will depend on your service provider).
When you go into the <span class="fileName">myusername</span>
directory with your FTP program you see your photos.
</p>
<p>
In this case your web server is mapping the <b>https://myallsky.com</b> URL to the
<span class="fileName">/myusername</span> directory,
and you need to copy files to the <span class="fileName">/myusername</span>
directory or anything below it.
</p>
<p>
You install the Allsky Website in the <span class="fileName">/myusername/allsky</span>
directory on the server.
The URL to the Allsky Website is still <b>https://mysite.com/allsky</b>,
but your <span class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span> needs settings like
<span class="shSetting">IMAGE_DIR</span>="<span class="editorString">/myusername/allsky</span>"
and so on.
</p>
<p>
Mapping of URLs to directories like this is fairly common on remote servers that
are shared by many people.

<h3>Certificate errors</h3>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
There are three main certificate-related error messages you'll see.
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Host key verification failed</b>
	<br>
	On the Pi, <code>ssh</code> to your remote server:
	<code>ssh -p 22 username@host</code>
	(replacing "username" and "host" with the appropriate values).
	The host will display a message and prompt for "yes" or "no".
	Enter "yes".
	This only needs to be done once for a given host.
	<br>The remote server now knows about the Pi.
<li><b>Certificate verification: certificate common name doesn't match requested host name "xyz.com"</b>
	<br>
	There are two ways to fix this:
	<ol>
	<li>Create a file called <span class="fileName">~/.lftprc</span> and add
	<code>set ssl:check-hostname false</code> to it:
		<pre>echo "set ssl:check-hostname" &gt; ~/.lftprc</pre>
	<li>Set <span class="shSetting">LFTP_COMMANDS</span> in
		<span class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span> to
		<code>set ssl:check-hostname false</code>.
     	If you expect to execute <code>lftp</code> manually the first method is better,
		otherwise use the second method so all your configuration changes are in one place.
	</ol>
<li><b>Certificate verification: Not trusted</b>
	<br>
	Add <code>set ssl:verify-certificate no</code> to
	<span class="shSetting">LFTP_COMMANDS</span> or the
	<span class="fileName">~/.lftprc</span> file as above.
</ol>
If your Pi's IP address changed, or the IP address remained but the
machine using the addressed changed, you probably need to remove the previous key from your
<span class="fileName">~/.ssh/known_hosts</span> file.
If the file has only one entry, simply remove it.
If the file has multiple entries, make a backup of the file,
then delete one entry at a time until you find the "bad" one.
</details>


<h3>Missing directories on the remote server</h3>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
<b>YOU</b> need to create the necessary directories on the remote server.
For example, if <span class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span> has
<span class="shSetting">KEOGRAM_DIR</span>=<span class="editorString">/allsky/keogram</span>,
make sure your remote server has a directory called <span class="fileName">/allsky/keogram</span>.
Note that some servers don't accept the leading
<span class="fileName">/</span> so you may need to set
<span class="shSetting">KEOGRAM_DIR</span>="<span class="editorString">allsky/keogram</span>".
</p>

</details>


<h3>Still having problems uploading?</h3>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Try this from the command line and see what messages it produces
(replace <code>XXXXX</code> with the value of <span class="shSetting">IMAGE_DIR</span> in the
<span class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span> file):  
<pre>
echo hi &gt; /tmp/test.txt
~/allsky/scripts/upload.sh --debug /tmp/test.txt XXXXX test.txt
</pre>
</p>
<p> 
This should upload the <span class="fileName">/tmp/test.txt</span>
file to the same directory where your images go.
It will also display the directory name it's in as well as the contents of that directory;
this can help you determine if your path names are correct or not.
</p>
<p>
A file called <span class="fileName">~/allsky/tmp/x-lftp_cmds.txt</span>
will be created that contains the <code>lftp</code> commands used to upload
<span class="fileName">/tmp/test.txt</span>.
Look in that file to make sure the username, password, and other information are correct.
If not, fix them in <span class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span>.
</p>
<p>
To see lftp messages line-by-line, enter <code>lftp</code> followed by the
<b>enter</b> key, then copy each line from the <span class="fileName">lftp_cmds.txt</span>
file and paste into the terminal window.
