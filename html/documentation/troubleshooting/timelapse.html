Timelapse video creation can fail for a number of reasons.
Luckily following the troubleshooting steps below will almost always fix it.
<p>

<h2>Timelapse video is not created</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Using the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Allsky Settings</span>
page, check that <span class="shSetting">TIMELAPSE</span> is "true"</span>
in <span class="fileName">config.sh</span>.
If it is, then you should see a message in
<span class="fileName">/var/log/allsky.log</span> like this:
<pre>
*** timelapse.sh: ERROR: ffmpeg failed.
Error log is in '/home/pi/allsky/tmp/timelapseTMP.txt'.
</pre>
(<code>ffmpeg</code> is the command that actually creates the video.)
</p>
<p>
Look at the <b>end</b> of the <span class="fileName">timelapseTMP.txt</span>
file for an error message that looks like one of the following:
<pre>
/home/pi/allsky/scripts/timelapse.sh: line 128: 6546 Killed ffmpeg -y -f image2 -loglevel ...
</pre>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>OR</b>
<pre>
x264 [error]: malloc of size 38600544 failed
</pre>
<p>
These errors are almost always caused by either not enough RAM memory and swap space,
or by having a large camera sensor (e.g., the RPi HQ).
</p>
<p>
To fix, do the following:
<ul>
<li>Decide if you need a full-resolution video.
	Most monitors only display High Definition (HD) which is 1920 x 1080 pixels.
	If your sensor size is larger than that you can decrease the
	<span class="shSetting">TIMELAPSEWIDTH</span> and
	<span class="shSetting">TIMELAPSEHEIGHT</span> settings in
	<span class="fileName">config.sh</span> to 1920 by 1080,
	adjusted for the aspect ratio of your sensor.
	Decreasing these values will also make the video file smaller.
	Even if your monitor can display higher resolution than HD,
	do other people who will view your video have monitors that can?  
	If this doesn't solve your problem, do the steps below.

<li>If you saw the <b>Killed</b> error in <span class="fileName">timelapseTMP.txt</span>,
	increase swap space (or buy a Pi with more memory).
	The Linux kernel will kill any process that is taking "too much" memory
	and swap space to avoid system issues.
	Click <a allsky="true" href="increaseSwap.html">here</a>
	for details on how to increase swap.

<li>Install <code>htop</code> via <code>sudo apt install htop</code>.
	It's a nicer version of <code>top</code>, and is great for checking
	<code>ffmpeg</code>'s memory use.
	Run <code>htop</code> in one terminal while running
	<code>scripts/generateForDay.sh -t DATE</code>
	in another terminal to check on <code>ffmpeg</code>'s memory use.
	<br>
	If the number in the "VIRT" (virtual memory) column of <code>htop</code>
	hits a maximum of around <b>2900M</b> and the timelapse fails,
	adding swap space will <u>unlikely</u> fix the issue so you'll need to try one
	of the other workarounds.

<li>The <b>malloc</b> error is often caused by using a very high resolution camera.
	The default video codec (<span class="shSetting">VCODEC</span>) in
	<span class="fileName">config.sh</span>
	is <span class="editorString">libx264</span>
	which has a stated maximum resolution of 4096 x 2304.
	However, the RPi HQ, ZWO ASI183, and some newer cameras have resolutions higher than that.
	If you saw the <b>malloc</b> error do one of the following:
	<ul>
	<li>Decrease the <span class="shSetting">TIMELAPSEWIDTH</span>
		and <span class="shSetting">TIMELAPSEHEIGHT</span>
		variables in <span class="fileName">config.sh</span>.
		For the RPi HQ camera (and likely any other camera),
		the maximum that actually works is 3810 x 2828
		(which interestingly is over the maximum for the <span class="editorString">libx264</span>
		<span class="shSetting">VCODEC</span>).
   	<li>Use the <span class="editorString">libx265</span>
		<span class="shSetting">VCODEC</span> in
		<span class="fileName">config.sh</span> along with
		<span class="shSetting">TIMELAPSE_EXTRA_PARAMETERS</span>="<span class="editorString">-x265-params crf=30</span>".
		This <span class="shSetting">VCODEC</span> takes a <u>long</u> time to create a video
		(over 3 hours on a PI 4b with 1650 RPi HQ images versus about 15 minutes
		with <span class="editorString">libx264</span>).
		Lower <b>crf</b> numbers (a measure of file compression) mean larger,
		higher-quality videos.
		Note that small changes to the number can result in <u>huge</u> difference in file size,
		for example, going from <span class="editorString">crf=30</span> to
		<span class="editorString">crf=25</span> can increase the video size by over <b>five</b> times.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Timelapse video doesn't have the correct number of images</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
The number of images (also called "frames") in a timelapse video is simply
the number of seconds long it is (including fractions of a second) times the
Frames Per Second (FPS) you set in <span class="fileName">config.sh</span>.
</p>
<p>
Execute the following to determine how many frames are in a video file as
well as the length in seconds.
Ignore the <code>fps</code> number,
and replace <code><i>YOUR_FILE</i></code> with the name of your video:
<pre>
ffmpeg -i <i>YOUR_FILE</i> -vcodec copy -f rawvideo -y /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 | tail -2
</pre>
</p>
<p>
We believe one cause for videos that are too short is zero-length files.
Apparently when <code>ffmpeg</code> encounters a zero-length file it quits.
Please make sure you have <span class="shSetting">REMOVE_BAD_IMAGES</span>
set to "true" in <span class="fileName">config.sh</span> so zero-length
and other "bad" images are not saved.
</p>
<p>
To remove zero-length files for a specified day, do the following,
replacing "DATE" with the name of directory in <code>allsky/images</code>:
<pre>cd ~/allsky/scripts; ./removeBadImages.sh DATE</pre>.
It will take a while to run.
When it's done you can re-create the timelapse by executing:
<pre>cd ~/allsky/scripts; ./generateForDay.sh -t DATE</pre>.
