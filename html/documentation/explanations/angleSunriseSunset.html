<h2>What does the "Angle" setting do?  How is it related to sunrise and sunset?</h2>
<p>
Your actual sunrise and sunset times are dependent on the day of the year and your
latitude and longitude, and define what most people call <b>daytime</b> and <b>nighttime</b>.
You can fool Allsky into thinking the sunrise and sunset are at
different times so it uses different times for daytime and nighttime.
</p>
<p>
Allsky defines <b>daytime</b> as your sunrise time <b>plus</b> an offset you define,
called the <b>Angle</b>.
The Angle is a positive or negative number that indicates the number of degrees
above (positive) or below (negative) the horizon the Sun is when daytime starts.
Daytime ends at sunset <b>minus</b> the Angle.
The term "daytime ends" is identical to "nighttime begins" since there
is no gap between daytime and nighttime.
</p>
<p>
As an example, assume the Sun rises at 7:00 AM and sets at 18:00 (6:00 PM).
Using an Angle of <code>0</code> degrees,
Allsky's daytime starts at 7:00 and nighttime starts at 18:00.
<blockquote>
The Sun moves at 15 degrees per hour, so 6 degrees is 24 minutes
(6 degrees / 15 degrees * 60 minutes).
<br>Remember: daytime ADDs the Angle and nighttime SUBTRACTs it.
</blockquote>
With an Angle of <code>6</code> degrees,
Allsky's daytime starts at 7:24 and nighttime at 16:36
(a total of 48 minutes less daytime).
An Angle of <code>-6</code> degrees would give 6:36 and 18:24
(48 minutes more daytime).
The Angle effectively determines the length of daytime - the
larger the Angle the shorter the daytime.
</p>
<p>
Why is this important?
Allsky uses it's calculated daytime to begin using your daytime settings like daytime exposure,
delay, etc.
If you told Allsky to not take pictures during the day,
it will use the Angle you've defined to determine its daytime,
and stop taking pictures what that time is reached.
Likewise, Allsky uses the start of nighttime to know when to begin using your nighttime settings.
</p>
<p>
Astrophotographers rarely start taking pictures at sunset since it's still too light.
Instead, they start taking pictures when it's much darker, often one of the following times:
<ul>
<li><b>Civil Twilight</b> goes from sunset to when the Sun is 6 degrees below the horizon
	(i.e., Angle of <code>-6</code>),
	and ends when the Sun is coming up and is 6 degrees below the horizon.
	It is still fairly light at Civil Twilight.
<li><b>Nautical twilight</b> uses 12 degrees for the cutoff point,
	at which point it's pretty dark (ignoring light pollution and the Moon).
<li><b>Astronomical Twilight</b> uses 18 degrees at which point it's as dark as it's going to get.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Many people use an Angle of <code>-6</code> for their allsky camera but it's
up to you to determine where the daytime versus nighttime boundary should be.
<blockquote>
Startrails, keograms, and timelapse videos are created at the end of nighttime,
so your Angle value will determine how dark or light the beginning of the timelapse video is.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
To determine Allsky's daytime and nighttime based on your Angle, execute:
<pre>
(source ~/allsky/scripts/functions.sh; get_sunrise_sunset)
</pre>
