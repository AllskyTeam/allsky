<p>
The code for the Allsky Website is installed as part of the Allsky installation on your Pi.
This page describes how to install and upgrade the Allsky Website on a remote server.
</p>
<p>
Make sure you have Allsky configured and working the way you want it
since some of its settings are also used by the Website
and you don't want to have to change them twice.
</p>

<p>
If you have an <b>existing</b> Allsky Website on your Pi,
the installation of Allsky will move images and videos from the prior Website
to the new Website.
If the prior Website was version <b>v2022.03.01+</b> or before
you need to manually copy your prior settings from 
<span class="fileName">/var/www/html/allsky/config.js</span> to
<span class="fileName">configuration.json</span> by going to the 
<span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> page in the WebUI and selecting
<code>configuration.json (local Allsky Website)</code>.
</p>
<p>
After configuring the local Website,
check in <span class="fileName">/var/www/html/allsky</span>
for any files you may have manually added.
If you find any, store them somewhere, and store <span class="fileName">config.js</span> as well.
Either way, remove the old Website:
<pre> rm -fr /var/www/html/allsky </pre>
</p>



<h2>Install on a remote server</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Most people have their Pi behind a firewall where it's not accessible on the Internet,
so they install the Allsky Website on a different
machine that <u>is</u> accessible on the Internet.
<blockquote>
If you want to make your Pi available on the Internet, see
<a external="true" href="https://medium.com/swlh/host-a-raspberry-pi-web-server-on-the-internet-89786287db77">these instructions</a>.
<br>
<strong>Be careful if you do this - if done incorrectly your Pi may be insecure.</strong>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Prior to installing the Website on a remote server,
make sure Allsky is working on your Pi, then do the following:
<ol>
<li>On the remote server:
	<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li>Create an <span class="fileName">allsky</span> directory to hold the Website.
		<strong>Keep track of where on your server you created the directory</strong>
		- you will need that information later when you tell Allsky where to upload the images.
	</ul>
<li>Copy ALL files and directories from <span class="fileName">~/allsky/html/allsky</span>
	on the Pi to the <span class="fileName">allsky</span> directory on your remote Website.
<li>Do <b>not</b> configure the remote Website yet - you'll do that below.
<li>On the Pi:
	<ol class="minimalPadding">
	<li>In the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Allsky Settings</span> page
		update the settings for the Remote Website.
		<blockquote>
			This step MUST be done before the next step since the next step
			tries to upload a test file to your remote server and it will fail
			if you haven't configured the settings properly.
		</blockquote>
	<li>Run <code>cd ~/allsky;  website/install.sh --remote</code>.
		This will upload a default configuration file to your server,
		leaving the master copy on the Pi.
		<ul>
		<li>If the upload fails, see the
			<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/troubleshooting/uploads.html">Troubleshooting uploads</a>
			page on how to debug the problem.
		<li>If you enabled the Allsky Website on your Pi,
			the remote configuration file will be identical to the local one with the
			exception of the <span class="editorSetting">imageName</span> and
			<span class="editorSetting">onPi</span> settings,
			which will be configured for a remote Website.
			<br>
			If you want the remote configuration to differ from the local one
			(for example, to add a background image to the remote Website),
			edit the remote configuration file - see the next step.
		</ul>
	<li>Configure the remote Website:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
			<li>In the WebUI, click on the <span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> link.
			<li>In the drop-down at the bottom of the page, select
				<code class="noWrap">remote_configuration.json (remote Allsky Website).</code>
			<li>See
				<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/settings/allskyWebsite.html">this page</a>
				for details on the Website settings.
		</ul>
		<blockquote class="warning">
		Whenever you update the remote Website's configuration you <strong>must</strong>
		do so via WebUI (follow the first two steps above).
		Do NOT edit the configuration file directly on the remote server.
		</blockquote>
	</ol>
<li>Your remote server is now ready.
<li>Give your family and friends the URL to your Allsky Website so they can enjoy your images!
</ol>


<h3>Remote Website Requirements</h3>
The remote server needs to support the following:
<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li>PHP version 7 or newer.
	<li>The <code>imagecreatefromjpeg</code> function in PHP to create thumbnails
		of the startrails and keogram files.
		If that function does not exist (which is rare),
		you'll see a thumbnail that says "No thumbnail".
		Everything else will still work.
	<li>The <code>ffmpeg</code> command and <code>exec</code> function in PHP
		to create thumbnails of the timelapse videos.
		<blockquote>
		Most hosting solutions don't support those commands for security reasons.
		In that case, make sure <span class="WebUISetting">Upload Timelapse Thumbnail</span>
		is enabled (and <span class="WebUISetting">Upload Mini-Timelapse Thumbnail</span>
		if you are creating mini timelapses).
		Failure to set those variables will result in "No thumbnail" messages when
		viewing videos.
		Everything else will still work.
		</blockquote>
</ul>

<h2>Post installation</h2>
<p>
Change
<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/settings/allskyWebsite.html">Allsky Website Settings</a>
as desired so the Website looks and behaves like you want it to.
Changes to both local Websites and remote Websites are both done via the WebUI.
</p>

<blockquote>
If you have both a local and a remote Website,
they each have their own configuration file which is
accessible via the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> page.
They are NOT automatically kept in sync so if you change something, for example,
the lens, you'll need to change it in both files.
