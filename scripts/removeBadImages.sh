# Super simple: find the full size image-*jpg and image-*png files (not the
# thumbnails) and ask imagemagick to compute a histogram (which is discarded)
# in order to capture the diagnostics from libjpeg. Will have to benchmark to
# be sure, but I suspect it's faster to produce histogram output than another
# image format which would be discarded anyway. If an input image does produce
# a warning message grep will match it and it will be deleted.
#
# This leaves us just images that decompress properly and won't introduce junk
# into the processing pipeline.
#
# Why on G-d's green earth would I do something like this? Because for whatever
# reason, my raspberry pi produces corrupt captures occasionally and this tool
# means I get good startrails and keograms in the morning.
