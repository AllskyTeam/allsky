If you have any icons, logos, web pages, or anything else that should be copied to new versions of Allsky
(along with images, videos, thumbnails, and the configuration file), store those files here.
The installation process for new Allsky versions moves this directory to the new location.

Anything not in this directory, or one of the items above will NOT be copied, hence will be lost during an upgrade.
