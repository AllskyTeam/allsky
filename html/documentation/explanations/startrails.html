A <b>startrails</b> is an image that contains all the images from a night on top of each other
in order to show star movement.
<blockquote>
Only nighttime images that are saved are included in a startrails,
so if you don't save your nightime images, they won't be included.
</blockquote>

<h2>Creating a startrails image</h2>
<p>
To have a startrails image <em>automatically</em> created at the end of each night,
enable the
<a allsky="true" external="true" href="/documentation/settings/allsky.html#startrails">
	<span class="WebUISetting">Generate</span></a>
setting in the <span class="subSettingsHeader">Startrails</span> sub-section of the WebUI.
</p>
<p>
To <em>manually</em> create a startrails image run the
<code>generateForDay.sh</code> command.
For example, to create and then upload a startrails to any Allsky Website and/or remote server 
you have for July 10, 2025:
<pre>
generateForDay.sh --startrails 20250710
generateForDay.sh --upload --startrails 20250710
</pre>
This will use the settings specified in the
<span class="subSettingsHeader">Startrails</span> sub-section of the WebUI.
</p>

<h4>Advanced users: running the <code>startrails</code> program manually</h4>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
<code>generateForDay.sh</code> calls the <code>startrails</code> program
to actually create the startrails, passing it several required arguments
(the <u>underlined</u> ones below),
plus any others you add to the 
<span class="WebUISetting">Startrails Extra Parameters</span> setting.
</p>
<p>
Executing the <code>startrails</code> manually is possible, but not very useful.
If run manually you need to specify at least all the required arguments.
</p>

<pre>
Usage: startrails [-v] -d &lt;dir&gt; -e &lt;ext&gt; [-b &lt;brightness&gt;] [-o &lt;output&gt;] [-S] [-s &lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;]

Arguments:
-h : display this help, then exit
-v : increase log verbosity
-S : print image directory statistics without producing image.
-s &lt;int&gt;x&lt;int&gt; : restrict processed images to this size
<u>-d &lt;str&gt;</u> : directory from which to read images (required)
<u>-e &lt;str&gt;</u> : filter images to just this extension (required)
<u>-o &lt;str&gt;</u> : output image filename
<u>-b &lt;float&gt;</u> : ranges from 0.0 (black) to 1.0 (white).
        A moonless sky may be as low as 0.05 while full moon can be as high as 0.4.
</pre>

<br><p>
Example of running the <code>startrails</code> program manually:
<pre>
cd ~/allsky/bin
./startrails -d images/20250710 -e jpg -b 0.15 -o images/20250710/startrails/startrails.jpg
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Startrails settings</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p id="brightnessthreshold">
The only configuration setting for startrails is
<span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>.
Images have an average, or "mean" brightness level from 0.0 (pure black)
to 1.0 (pure white).
The default <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>
is <span class="WebUIValue">0.1</span>
which is a fairly dark image, typical of a moon-less night.
</p>
<p>
Any image with an average brightness <strong>greater than</strong>
the <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>
is skipped during startrails generation,
so daytime images should be skipped.
<strong>You need to experiment with this setting to get the best results</strong>,
as allsky cameras, lenses, and sky conditions impact an image's average brightness,
and hence what you use for this setting.
Every time a startrails image is created a summary of brightness values is saved to the
Allsky log file.
</p>
<p>
If you aren't seeing trailed stars in your images and you get a message like
"<b>No images below threshold 0.100, writing the minimum image only</b>",
your images are too bright and
<span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span> needs to be reduced.
To determine what to number to use
you need to know the typical <b>nighttime</b> sky brightness value.
Do the following:
<ol>
	<li>Run <code>allsky-config &nbsp; get_brightness_info</code>
		to see what your brightness values are.
	<li>If there is no data yet a message will appear with a possible reason,
		otherwise the output will look like:
<pre>
Date                   Minimum   Maximum   Mean      Median    Images used   Not used
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2025-01-17  06:20:45   0.084     0.146     0.103     0.105     250           3
2025-01-18  06:16:18   0.045     0.135     0.102     0.106     247           6
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total average          0.065     0.140     0.103     0.106     497           9
</pre>
		<blockquote>
		Note that the Mean brightness is determined by looking at the <em>whole</em> image,
		including any black areas.
		This number is likely different from the mean brightness that can be overlayed
		onto your images, which is determined by looking at the
		<em>central portion</em> of an image.
		<p>
		If you crop your image, add a mask to it, or change cameras you'll most likely
		need to update the <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span> setting.
		</p>
		</blockquote>
	<li>Set the <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>
		to the <strong>Maximum</strong>, or slightly below it.
		If you have a <code>Total average</code>, use its Maximum.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
You'll now create a startrails and if needed, change
<span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>,
then create another startrails, change the setting, etc.
<ol>
	<li>To make startrails generation MUCH faster,
		do it using a small number of images.
	<li>Create a temporary directory to hold some nighttime images:
		<code>mkdir ~/allsky/images/test</code>.
	<li><code>cd ~/allsky/images/DATE</code>,
		replacing <code>DATE</code> with the date of a non-working startrails.
	<li>Using the timestamp of each image,
		move a few hours of <b>nighttime</b> images to the
		<span class="fileName">~/allsky/images/test</span> directory:
		<ul>
			<li>If you are running SAMBA (<code>allsky-config  samba</code>) you can view
				the files from your PC or Mac and then select some files with the mouse and
				drag to the <span class="fileName">test</span> directory.
			<li>If you are not running SAMBA and you are logged into the Pi desktop,
				open a "File Manager" window on the Pi and drag/drop the files.
			<li>If neither of the above work for you,
				you'll need to use the <code>mv</code> command to move the files.
				Using the <code>*</code> wildcard in the file names will allow you to move
				multiple files at a time.
				<br>For example: <code>mv 2025071001* ../test</code> to move all the images taken
				from 1:00 AM to 1:59 AM.
		</ul>
	<li>Run <code>generateForDay.sh --startrails  test</code>
		to create a startrails file in the <span class="fileName">test</span> directory.
		Look at the image using the <span class="WebUILink">Images</span> page in the WebUI.
		Also look at the <code>Images used</code> and <code>Not used</code> columns of the output.
	<li>As needed, adjust <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>
		and re-run <code>generateForDay.sh</code>.
	<li>When done, move all the images from the
		<span class="fileName">allsky/images/test</span> directory
		back to <span class="fileName">allsky/images/DATE</span>.
	<li>Remove the temporary directory: <code>rmdir ~/allsky/images/test</code>.
	<li>Now, create the final startrails:
		<ul class="minimalPadding topPadding">
			<li><code>generateForDay.sh --startrails DATE</code>
			<li>If you want to upload the file you just created,
				see the note generated by <code>generateForDay.sh</code>.
		</ul>
</ol>
</p>
</details>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p id="troubleshooting">
<blockquote>
It's extremely rare that a startrails image isn't created at all.
It's much more common that an image <strong>is</strong> created but none of the stars have trails.
If none of the stars have trails,
see the <a href="#brightnessthreshold">Startrails settings</a> section above.
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="warning">
The resolution of all images must be identical;
if not, only images with the same resolution as the FIRST image are used.
<br>
This can happen if the daytime and nighttime
<span class="WebUISetting">Binning</span> settings are not the same,
or any day you change the <span class="WebUISetting">Image Resize</span> and/or
<span class="WebUISetting">Image Crop</span> settings.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>If a startrails image isn't being created, make sure the Startrails
		<span class="WebUISetting">Generate</span> setting is enabled.
		If it IS enabled, run:
		<pre>generateForDay.sh  --startrails  DATE</pre>
		replacing <code>DATE</code> with a valid date like <code>20250710</code> and check for errors.
	<li>If a startrails image is created but not <em>uploaded</em>, make sure the
		Startrails <span class="WebUISetting">Upload</span> setting is enabled.
		If that IS enabled, run:
		<pre>generateForDay.sh  --upload  --debug  --startrails  DATE</pre>
		and check for errors.
		If needed, run <code>testUpload.sh</code> to see why the upload fails.
</ul>
