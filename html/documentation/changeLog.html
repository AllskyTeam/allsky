				</ul>

<!--
				<h4>Deleted capabilities</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
				</ul>
-->

				<h4>Enhancements / Changes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>WebUI changes:
						<ul>
							<li>Several menu items are now grouped together;
								putting your cursor over them or clicking on them
								shows a list of choices.
								<br>
								For example, the <span class="WebUILink">Settings</span>
								group contains
								<span class="WebUILink">Allsky Settings</span>
								and
								<span class="WebUILink">Editor</span>.
							<li><span class="WebUILink">Images</span> page:
								<ul>
									<li>Now only shows the
										<a href="" style="pointer-events: none;"><i class="fa fa-image fa-fw"></i></a>
										icon if there is at least one image for the day
										otherwise "none" is displayed.
									<li>The timelapse and mini-timelapse icons on this page
										as well as on the Allsky Website home page on the left side changed to
										<a href="" style="pointer-events: none"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-video"></i></a>
										and
										<a href="" style="pointer-events: none"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-file-video"></i></a>
										respectively.
									<li>If there are no images, startrails, keogram, or timelapse
										for a given day, that day is no longer included in the list.
									<li>Directories in the <span class="fileName">images</span>
										directory that start with
										<span class="fileName">test</span> are now
										displayed along with the days.
										This is useful if you want to create a "test" directory
										with various images.
										<br>
										Note that the 
										<span class="WebUILink">Startrails</span>
										and
										<span class="WebUILink">Image Stretch</span>
										helper tools create directories that are visible.
<!--
									<li>The icons indicating there are images, a timelapse,
										a keogram, and/or a startrails are now the same
										height as the "Delete" button.
									<li>If a timelapse, keogram, and/or startrails thumbnail
										exists for a day, it is displayed instead of the
										generic icon.
-->
								</ul>
							<li>You can now view the mini-timelapse (if it exists) via the link at the top
								of the <span class="WebUILink">Live View</span> page.
							<li><span class="WebUILink">Overlay Editor</span> page:
								<ul>
									<li><span style="color: red">Alex to add changes...</span>
								</ul>
							<li><span class="WebUILink">Module Manager</span> page:
								<ul>
									<li><span style="color: red">Alex to add changes...</span>
								</ul>
							<li>The new <span class="WebUILink">Charts</span> page
								allows you to add charts for camera, hardware, and
								analysis data.
								Try it out!
							<li>The new <span class="WebUILink">Helper Tools</span>
								pages "helps" you do something:
								<ul>
								<li><span class="WebUILink">Check Allsky</span>
									runs the <code>checkAllsky.sh</code> command to identify
									Allsky settings that have errors or may cause problems.
								<li><span class="WebUILink">Startrails</span>
									helps you determine what
									<span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>
									setting to use.
									You specify multiple setting and
									the page then creates startrails images with those
									settings which you can then view to decide which
									setting you prefer.
									<br>
									This page is a front end to
									<code>allsky-config  compare_startrails</code>.
								<li><span class="WebUILink">Image Stretch</span>
									helps you determine what daytime and/or nighttime
									<span class="WebUISetting">Stretch Amount</span>
									and
									<span class="WebUISetting">Stretch Mid Point</span>
									settings to use.
									<br>
									This page is a front end to
									<code>allsky-config  compare_stretches</code>.
								</ul>
							<li>The menu on the left side of the WebUI can now be
								collapsed to show just icons on smaller screens.
						</ul>
					<li>Startrails:
						<ul>
							<li>The <code>generateForDay.sh</code> command
								accepts a file that contains the images to process,
								which means a subset of the files in a directory
								can be used (e.g., just the nighttime files) or
								files from multiple nights can be used.
								<br>
								For example:
								<code>generateForDay.sh --startrails --images file</code>.
							<li>The <code>allsky-config &nbsp; get_startrails_info</code>
								command (previously called <code>get_brightness_info</code>)
								now displays the
								<span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>
								in use when each startrails image was created.
						</ul>
					<li>The camera now saves initial images to
						<span class="fileName">~/allsky/tmp/current_images</span>,
						and that's where the WebUI
						<span class="WebUILink">Live View</span> page looks for the image.
						<br>
						The current mini-timelapse file is also saved there.
						<br>NOTE: the <span class="editorSetting">imageName</span>
						field in the local Allsky Website configuration file is now
						<span class="editorString">/current/image.jpg</span>.
					<li>The <code>generateForDay.sh</code> command now accepts
						arguments that can be passed to the keogram, startrails,
						and timelapse creation programs.
						Run <code>generateForDay.sh --help</code>
						to see uses of the new arguments.

					<li>The <code>allsky-config &nbsp; bad_images_info</code>
						command can now display the list of "bad" images when
						the <code>--show_bad_images</code> argument is specified.
						This command is very helpful in tuning the
						Low and High
						<span class="WebUISetting">Remove Bad Images Threshold</span>
						settings.
<!--
							<li>When called at end of night, startrails creates
								saves information on the run in the Allsky database.
-->
					<li>Updated to ZWO SDK v1.39 which adds supports for the
						ASI582MC, Seestar 585MC, 4400MC Pro, 585MM Mini, 662MM Mini, and 992MM Pro cameras.
						It drops support for the 366MC Pro camera.
				</ul>

				<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Fix an issue with not all thumbnails being displayed when
						viewing a day that has thousands of images.
					<li>Fix an issue with notification images (e.g., "Allsky is Starting")
						not being sent to a remote server.
					<li>Fixed an issue with updates to the Allsky Map server failing
						because of a missing file.
						A detailed System Message is now displayed in the WebUI
						if that happens.
				</ul>

				<h4>Deleted Settings</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The <span class="settingsHeader">Image Overlay Settings</span>
						section of the WebUI's
						<span class="WebUILink">Allsky Settings</span> page was
						deleted.
						<br>For ZWO cameras, the
						<span class="WebUISetting">Show Histogram Box</span> setting
						is now the <span class="moduleName">ZWO Exposure Box</span>
						module in the
						<span class="managerName">Module Manager</span>.
				</ul>
				<h4>New Settings</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The <span class="WebUISetting">Dark Frame Upper Threshold</span>
						setting specifies when a dark frame is "too bright",
						usually because the lens isn't fully covered when taking darks.
						It can also happen if your camera is very noisy.
					<li>The <span class="WebUISetting">Remove Bad Images Threshold Count</span>
						setting determines after how many "bad" images a System Message
						and notification image will be displayed.
				</ul>

		<details open> <summary></summary>

			<h3>v2024.12.06_06  - Point Release # 6</h3>
			<details open sub> <summary></summary>
				<h4 style="color: red">IMPORTANT NOTES:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>This is the LAST major release that supports Buster.
					<li>This is the LAST major release that contains the "legacy"
						overlay method.
				</ul>

				<h4>Enhancements / Changes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>When 4 consecutive errors occur while capturing images
						with an RPi camera, the last error is now shown
						in the WebUI's "System Messages" section.
					<li>The <code>allsky-config get_brightness_info</code> command
						now outputs the number of images used and not used in the startrails.
					<li>Added a
						<a external="true" allsky="true"
							href="/documentation/troubleshooting/troubleshootingTools.html">Troubleshooting Tools</a>
						Documentation page to list tools to aid in troubleshooting.
				</ul>

				<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Fixed an issue where downloading the support log from the
						<span class="WebUILink">Getting Support</span>
						page would hang the page.
					<li>Fixed a couple issues with WebUI "System Messages":
						<ol>
							<li>Some messages were displayed hundreds or thousands
								of times rather than being displayed once with a
								number of occurrences greater than 1.
							<li>A message was truncated when unable to download the
								<span class="fileName">de421.bsp</span> file.
						</ol>
					<li>Fixed an issue with updates to the Allsky Map server failing
						because multiple double quotes were in a field.
					<li>Fixed a rare situation where the
						<span class="managerName">Module Manager</span>
						will fail to display any modules due to corruption in
						a module's metaData.
				</ul>

				<h4>New Settings</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>None
				</ul>
			</details>

			<h3>v2024.12.06_05  - Point Release # 5</h3>
			<details sub> <summary></summary>

				<h4>Changes that may require action (upgrades only)</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><blockquote class="warning">
						The changes in this section may require settings changes;
						after upgrading, check that your settings and images look right.
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>If your Keogram <span class="WebUISetting">Font Color</span>
						contained three numbers you'll need to reverse the order
						of the numbers.
						<br>This setting previously accepted two formats:
						<ol>
							<li><code>blue_number green_number red_number</code>
								(with spaces or commas separating the numbers)
								where each number is from <code>0</code> to <code>255</code>.
							<li><code>#RRGGBB</code> where each two-digit pair
								goes from hex <code>00</code> to <code>ff</code>.
						</ol>
						<p>
						To be consistent with the hex order and with web pages,
						the order of the first format is now:
						<code>red_number green_number blue_number</code>
						(red and blue switched places).
						<br>The order of the second format did not change but
						it now accepts either 3 or 6 hex digits.
						<br>See <a external="true" allsky="true"
							href="/documentation/settings/allsky.html#keogramfontcolor">
							the documentation</a> for more details on this setting.
						</p>
				</ul>

				<h4>Enhancements / Changes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The <code>allsky-config &nbsp; get_brightness_info</code>
						command now displays how many images were used, and not used,
						in each startrail image.
						This is useful when setting the 
						<span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>.
				</ul>

				<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>For RPi cameras, the length of time Allsky waits before
						timing out an image was increased.
						For some Pi's, the prior 30-second timeout was too short
						when the Pi was extremely busy such as during
						timelapse creation.
					<li>Entering a <span class="WebUISetting">Locale</span> in the WebUI
						that is not installed on the Pi displays an error message and lists
						the locales that ARE installed and tells the user how
						to install other locales.
					<li>Mono cameras were calculating the mean image brightness
						twice: once prior to the initial save of the image
						and a second time when determining if the image was too
						dark or too bright.
						The second time used a different formula than the first time.
				</ul>

				<h4>New Settings</h4>

					<li><span class="WebUISetting">None</span>

				</ul>
			</details>

			<h3>v2024.12.06_04  - Point Release # 4</h3>
			<details sub> <summary></summary>

				<h4>Enhancements / Changes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>When upgrading from a recent version from Allsky
						you'll likely just need to restart Allsky
						without having to review the settings.
						The installation script will tell you what to do.
					<li>In addition to the WebUI telling you when a new Allsky
						version is available, an optional note about the new version
						will be displayed, such as
						"Contains an important security update; please install".
					<li>The Allsky "Status:" on the top of the WebUI
						now updates automatically every few seconds.
					<li>The <span class="WebUILink">System</span> WebUI page
						now appears very quickly and some of the data is automatically
						updated every few seconds.
						<br>Usage of <span class="fileName">~/allsky/tmp</span> is now displayed.
						<br>The "Refresh" button is no longer needed so was removed.
					<li>The <span class="WebUILink">Editor</span> WebUI page
						will display a message in the unlikely event that the
						file is corrupted.
					<li>RPi cameras sometimes hang while taking pictures.
						This used to hang Allsky, but it now times out instead.
					<li>When RPi cameras are unable to take an image,
						an error message from the camera is added to the log file.
						Previously the error message was written to a temporary
						file that was overwritten every exposure, thereby
						losing prior messages.
					<li>A message is added to the WebUI if creation of a timelapse,
						startrails, or keogram fails during end-of-night processing.
					<li>If the <span class="WebUISetting">Keograms Font Color</span> begins with a
						<span class="WebUIValue">0</span> and does not have 6 characters after it,
						e.g., <span class="WebUIValue">#fff</span>,
						an error message is displayed in the WebUI.
						Those values didn't produce the color expected, for example,
						<span class="WebUIValue">#fff</span> produced blue labels, not white.
					<li>The name of the Pi is shown at the top of the WebUI.
						This is useful for people with multiple Pi's.
				</ul>

				<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The <span class="WebUILink">Getting Support</span> WebUI page
						(and the related <code>support.sh</code> command) no longer
						fail with an "Argument list too long" message.
						<br>
						They also provide more information to aid in troubleshooting.
					<li>Setting a target temperature for cooled ZWO cameras now works.
					<li><code>install.sh</code> no longer corrupts the Website
						configuration file when adding meteor fields.
					<li><code>remoteWebsiteInstall.sh</code> now handles servers that
						don't return anything under certain circumstances.
						This is uncommon but when it happened it kept the
						remote Website from being installed.
					<li>Permission denied errors from <code>moduleutil.php</code>
						when it tried to overwrite files ending in
						<span class="fileName">-last</span> has been fixed.
					<li>The Allsky Website now correctly colors aurora forecasts.
					<li><code>upload.sh</code> no longer finds files that don't exist.
					<li>During installation, the amount of RAM for non-Raspberry Pi
						boards is now determined correctly.
						This number is used to properly size the swap space.
						It's also used to populate the
						<span class="WebUISetting">Computer</span> setting.
				</ul>

				<h4>Deleted Settings</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="WebUISetting">Notification Images</span>
						<br>
						Notification images, e.g., "Allsky is starting up" provide
						valuable status and troubshooting information so can no longer
						be disabled.

				<h4>Enhancements / Changes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>RPi cameras that report sensor temperature now support
						<strong>dark frames</strong>.
						<br>The TEMPERATURE_C and TEMPERATURE_F variables can
						be displayed in overlays for these cameras.

						<details sub><summary></summary>
						<ul>
							<li>RPi cameras that report sensor temperature
								and support dark frames:
								<ul>
									<li>HQ
									<li>Module 3
									<li>Arducam 16 MP
								</ul>
							<li>These cameras do not support darks:
								<ul>
									<li>Version 1
									<li>imx290 60.00 fps
									<li>Arducam 64 MP
									<li>Arducam 462
									<li>Waveshare imx219-d160
									<li>Arducam 64 MB Owlsight
									<li>OneInchEye IMX283
								</ul>
						</ul>
						</details>

					<li>Dark frames are now saved as <span class="fileName">.png</span>
						files for better quality.
						<blockquote>
						If you have any <span class="fileName">.jpg</span> darks
						in <span class="fileName">~/allsky/darks</span>
						we suggest re-doing your darks then removing the old
						<span class="fileName">.jpg</span> darks.
						</blockquote>
				</ul>

				<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>MOON variables work in the
						<span class="WebUILink">Overlay Editor</span>
						(the <span class="fileName">de421.bsp</span> file downloads correctly).
					<li>All the "Click here to ..." messages in the WebUI now work.

					<li>The `remoteWebsiteInstall.sh` command now works if the
						<span class="WebUISetting">Image Directory</span> setting is empty.
					<li>Duplicate System Messages now have the correct count of the number
						of times the problem occurred.
				</ul>

				<h4>Deleted Settings</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="WebUISetting">Camera</span>
						and <span class="WebUISetting">Computer</span>.
						<br>These values are automatically set during installation so
						no longer need to be prompted for.
				</ul>
				<h4>New Settings</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="WebUISetting">Equipment Info</span>
					<br>This optional setting is used to add any additional information
					about the equipment you are using,
					for example, if you are using a NoIR (no infra-red filter)
					version of a camera.
					<br>This information will appear on any Allsky Website you have.
				</ul>
			</details>


			<h3>v2024.12.06_02  - Point Release # 2</h3>
			<details sub> <summary></summary>
				<h4>Enhancements / Changes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The WebUI will now notify you when a new Allsky version is available.
					<li>The <code>remoteWebsiteInstall.sh</code> command does a better
						job telling you why problems occur and how to fix them.
					<li>Additions to the <code>allsky-config</code> command:
						<ul>
							<li>If you are seeing a <b>Multiple consecutive bad images</b>
								message in the WebUI, run
								<code>allsky-config &nbsp;bad_images_info</code>.
								It will suggest how to fix the problem.
							<li>If a local or remote Allsky Website has a problem reading
								the <span class="fileName">data.json</span> file,
								you are now directed to run the new
								<code>allsky-config &nbsp;check_post_data</code> command.
								It tries to determine why the message occurred.
							<li>The <code>allsky-config &nbsp;move_images</code> command
								is more robust and allows you to move the images back to the
								<span class="fileName">~/allsky/images</span>
								folder if desired.
						</ul>
					<li>When an Allsky Website is stuck on the "Loading ..." message
						because it can't find the current image,
						you'll get a message telling you how to fix it.
					<li>Several Allsky Website files are now in subdirectories, e.g.,
						all the "css" files are in a <span class="fileName">css</span> directory.
						No user action is needed.
					<li>You can now have custom "notification images" like
						"Allsky is starting up".
						To do so, create a
						<span class="fileName">~/allsky/config/myFiles/notificationImages</span>
						directory, then put your custom images there using the exact same names
						as the Allsky files in 
						<span class="fileName">~/allsky/notificationImages</span>.
				</ul>

				<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

				<h4>Enhancements / Changes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>You can no longer enter <strong>Issues</strong> in GitHub
						(you can still enter <strong>Discussions</strong>).
						Instead, use the new <span class="WebUILink">Getting Support</span>
						page in the WebUI to automatically collect the information
						needed to troubleshoot your problem.
						Simply following the instructions on that page.
						<br>NO private information is sent; that information is kept in
						the <span class="fileName">~/allsky/env.json</span> file which
						should never be uploaded.
					<li>The WebUI's <span class="WebUILink">Editor</span> page now:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">

						</ul>
					<li>The WebUI now displays the status of Allsky (Running, Stopped, etc.).
						The status is determined every time a WebUI page is displayed,
						so if the status changes while you are on a page it won't be
						updated until the page is refreshed.
					<li>You can now easily specify a location to store Allsky's image
						other than in <span class="fileName">~/allsky/images</span>.
						This is typically done to store images on an SSD or a
						similar larger, faster, and more reliable media than an SD card.
						See the <code>allsky-config &nbsp;move_images</code> command.
					<li>If you are having problems getting startrails to show the trails,
						the new <code>allsky-config &nbsp;get_brightness_info</code> command
						helps by displaying information on image brightness determined during
						startrails generation.
						That information helps determine what to put in the
						<span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span> setting.
						See <a allsky="true" external="true"
							href="/documentation/explanations/startrails.html#brightnessthreshold">
							Startrails settings</a>
						for details.
					<li>The new <code>allsky-config &nbsp;compare_paths</code> command helps
						determine where to upload your remote Website files and what URL to use.
						See the <a allsky="true" external="true"
							href="/documentation/explanations/serverLocationToURL.html">
							Mapping Server Locations to URLs</a>
						page for details.
					<li>The <code>allsky-config</code> command can do more,
						including lettings you change the size of the
						<span class="fileName">~/allsky/tmp</span> directory
						and the amount of swap space.
						Run <code>allsky-config</code> for a full list of what it can do.
					<li>The new <span class="fileName">meteors</span> directory in
						Allsky Websites is to upload images with meteors.
						A meteor icon can be displayed to the list of icons
						on the left side of a Website page by
						setting the "display" line to "true" in the "Archived Meteors" section
						of the associated <span class="fileName">configuration.json</span> file.
						<br><strong>NOTE: Support for saving and uploading images with
						meteors will be added in a future Allsky release.</strong>
					<li>The <code>remoteWebsiteInstall.sh</code> command now prompts
						to upload any local startrails, keograms, and timelapse files.
						It's also more "polished", doesn't fail as often,
						and provides better messages.
					<li>Allsky Websites now give a detailed message when they can't
						find the image, instead of just the "Loading..." picture forever.
				</ul>
				<h4>New Settings</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="WebUISetting">None</span>
				</ul>
				<h4>Deleted Settings</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>To further simplify configuring a remote Website and
						remove a source of user error,
						changing the names of the timelapse, keogram, and startrails files
						uploaded to a remote Website is no longer allowed
						(these already couldn't be changed for local Websites).
						Hence, the
						<span class="WebUISetting">Remote Video File Name</span>,
						<span class="WebUISetting">Remote Keogram File Name</span>, and
						<span class="WebUISetting">Remote Startrails File Name</span>
						settings in the
						<span class="subSettingsHeader">Remote Website</span>
						sub-section of the WebUI were deleted.
				</ul>
				<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Allsky Website icon sorting by date now works.
					<li><code>remoteWebsiteInstall.sh</code> no longer fails if you have
						commands in the <span class="WebUISetting">FTP Commands</span> setting.
					<li>Changes to the image resize settings in the WebUI are now saved.
					<li><code>allsky.sh --help</code> now works and displays all the
						options to the capture programs.
					<li>Many others including with modules and overlays.

			<h3>v2024.12.06 - Base Release</h3>
			<details> <summary></summary>
			<h4>Changes that may require action (upgrades only)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><blockquote class="warning">
					The changes in this section may require settings changes;
					after upgrading, check that your settings and images look right.
					</blockquote>
				</li>
				<li>The <span class="fileName">config.sh</span>
					and <span class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span>
					files are gone - their settings are now in the WebUI.
					<br><span class="possibleAction">Possible action: </span>
					The upgrade should migrate your prior settings to the WebUI
					unless you have a very old version of Allsky in which case
					you'll be notified during the upgrade on what to do.
				</li>
				<li>The <b>CROP</b> settings have been simplified to specifiy the number
					of pixels to crop from the top, right, bottom, and left of an image.
					<br><span class="possibleAction">Possible action: </span>
					If you cropped your images the upgrade will notify you
					to re-enter the settings using the new fields.
				</li>
				<li>The <span class="WebUISetting">Remove Bad Images Thresholds</span>
					settings are now between 0.0 and 1.0 instead of 0 - 100.
					<br><span class="possibleAction">Possible action: </span>
					The upgrade should adjust your threshold values to the
					new range, but check.
				</li>
				<li>Allsky now uses the mean brightness of an image
					to determine if it is too bright or too dark.
					This is the same way auto-exposure determines the exposure to use.
					Prior releases looked at the whole image including any dark borders.
					<br><span class="possibleAction">Possible action: </span>
					You may need to adjust your
					<span class="WebUISetting">Remove Bad Images Thresholds</span>
					to take into account for this change.
				</li>
				<li>(ZWO only) The mean brightness of an images is
					now a number between 0.0 and 1.0; it used to be 0 - 255.
					This matches the <span class="WebUISetting">Mean Target</span>
					settings which have always been between 0.0 and 1.0 as well as the
					<span class="WebUISetting">Remove Bad Images Thresholds</span>.
					settings, making it easier to determine what values to use.
					<br><span class="possibleAction">Possible action: </span>
					If the <b>MEAN</b> variable is on your overlay you may need
					to change the format it's displayed in.
					A two or three-digit number is best.
				</li>
				<li>The WebUI now hides the settings in each section unless there's
					an error in that section.
					To view a section's settings, click the
					<i class='fa fa-chevron-down fa-fw'></i> symbol on the left side
					of a section heading.
					<br><span class="possibleAction">Possible action: </span>
					This may take a little time to get used to.
					However, with the significant increase in WebUI settings
					it would be difficult to find what you want if
					the sections weren't hidden.
				</li>
				<li><code>check_allsky.sh</code> is now called
					<code>checkAllsky.sh</code>
					to be consistant with other program names.
					<br><span class="possibleAction">Possible action: </span> None.
			</ul>

			<h4>Enhancements / Changes</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Setting up an Allsky Website on the Pi is now trivial - just enable the
					the <span class="WebUISetting">Use Local Website</span> setting
					and optionally set the number of days' images to keep via the
					<span class="WebUISetting">Days To Keep on Pi Website</span> setting.
					No more trying to figure out how to set the variables!
				</li>
				<li>Setting up a Website on a remote server is easier since the only
					directory you have to specify is the top-level
					<span class="WebUISetting">Image Directory</span> in the WebUI.
				</li>
				<li>Installing a Website on a remote server is significantly easier as well.
					Use the new <code>remoteWebsiteInstall.sh</code> command;
					it will upload the Allsky Website files for you and remove any
					old, unneeded files.
					If this is a new remote Website,
					<code>remoteWebsiteInstall.sh</code> will ask you whether or not to
					also upload any startrails, keograms, and timelapse videos on your Pi.
				</li>
				<li>Images, timelapse, keograms, and startrails can now be written
					to a <u>remote server</u> in addition to, or instead of, a remote Website.
					This is useful if you want to include those images in a different website
					or want to archive them.
				</li>
				<li>The new <code>allsky-config</code> command
					is similar to the <code>raspi-config</code> command
					but for Allsky information and configuration.
					This command is mentioned in several documentation pages
					(as well as below) to easily describe how to do something.
					<br>
					Execute <code>allsky-config</code> to see what it can do.
				</li>
				<li>Running <code>allsky-config   samba</code>
					allows you to mount the <span class="fileName">~/allsky</span>
					directory on a PC or MAC.
					See <a allsky="true" external="true"
						href="/documentation/explanations/SAMBA.html">Copy files to / from a Pi</a>
					for more information.
				</li>
				<li>The new <code>testUpload.sh</code> command
					tries to upload a test file to either a remote Website or remote server.
					If the upload fails, the command
					<strong>attempts to tell you why it failed and what to do about it</strong>.
				</li>
				<li>When changing settings, Allsky only restarts if it needs to.
					Some settings, like the <span class="WebUISetting">Owner</span>
					don't impact taking images so there's no reason to restart Allsky.
					A few settings cause Allsky to stop after being changed.
					Hovering you mouse over a WebUI data field displays a popup
					that indicates what will happen after changing that field.
				</li>
				<li>The <span class="WebUIValue">module</span>
					<span class="WebUISetting">Overlay Method</span>
					is now the default for new installations.
					In the next major Allsky release the <span class="WebUIValue">legacy</span>
					method will be removed and the only way to add text will be using the
					<span class="editorName">Overlay Editor</span>.
				</li>
				<li>You can now have more than one ZWO camera connected,
					and on the Pi 5, more than one RPi camera connected.
					The installation will show ALL attached cameras.
				</li>
				<li>If you change cameras without notifying Allsky
					(e.g., you shutdown the Pi, replace the camera with a different model,
					then restart the Pi), Allsky will not start and will put a
					message in the WebUI telling you how to properly change cameras.
					No message will be given if you replace a camera with the same model,
					e.g., an RPi HQ with another RPi HQ camera.
				</li>
				<li>If you try using an <u>unsupported</u> camera you'll
					receive a message stating that and telling you what to do
					and how to request support for the camera.
				</li>
				<li>All ZWO cameras as of September 7, 2024 are supported (library version 1.36).
				</li>
				<li>Support for some new third-party RPi cameras was added.
					<blockquote>
					Run
					<code>allsky-config  show_supported_cameras</code>
					to see the supported ZWO and RPi cameras.
					<p>
					The ZWO list is over 130 entries so if you want to check
					if a camera you're considering getting is supported, run:
					</p>
					<pre>allsky-config  show_supported_cameras --zwo | grep -i "CAMERA_NAME"</pre>
					replacing <code>CAMERA_NAME</code> with the name with <strong>OUT</strong>
					<code>ASI</code>, e.g., <code>178mc</code>.
					<p>Checking for an RPi camera is easier:
					<pre>allsky-config  show_supported_cameras --rpi</pre>
					</blockquote>
				</li>
				<li>The <span class="WebUILink"><strong>LAN</strong> Dashboard</span>
						and <span class="WebUILink"><strong>WLAN</strong> Dashboard</span>
						WebUI pages now display <strong>all</strong>
						network adapters, regardless of their names.
				</li>
				<li>The <span class="fileName">endOfNight_additionalSteps.sh</span>
					file is no longer supported.
					The few people that had that file should use the "night to day"
					module flow instead.
				</li>
				<li>When taking dark frames, any images that is too bright is deleted.
					This can happen if you start taking darks before covering the lens
					or if the lens cover lets in some light, e.g., a plastic lens cap.
				</li>
				<li>DHCP on the Pi can be configured via the WebUI's
					<span class="WebUILink">Configure DHCP</span> page.
					This is an advanced option that is not used very often.
				</li>
				<li>Overlay changes:
					<ul>
						<li>The overlay module debugging output is easier to read.</li>
						<li>You can now create different overlays for daytime and nighttime.
							The new <span class="managerName">Overlay Manager</span>
							is available from the main toolbar in the
							<span class="editorName">Overlay Editor</span>.
							Several overlay templates for different cameras are provided
							which can be customised to your requirements.
							If you have customised the overlay then during the upgrade
							process a new custom overlay will be created for you and assigned
							to both daytime and nighttime captures.
							If you have not customised the overlay then Allsky will
							attempt to use the best overlay for your camera.</li>
						<li>The <span class="editorName">Overlay Editor</span>
							will display a warning if any of the fields on the overlay
							are outside the image area.
							The fields can be fixed which will move them into the bounds of the image.
							See <a href="https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky/issues/3317"
								allsky="true" external="true">[BUG] If a field is outside the image ...</a></li>
						<li>If images are not being captured the
							<span class="editorName">Overlay Editor</span> will not start and
							will display a message and wait until images are being captured.
							This prevents a (usually much smaller) notification image
							from being used as the <span class="editorName">Overlay Editor</span>
							background.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>See <a href="/documentation/modules/modules.html" allsky="true" external="true">Modules Documentation</a>
					for details on Extra Module changes.
				<li>New Modules:
					<ul class="minimalPadding">
						<li><strong>Allsky AI</strong> - Detects cloud cover using AI</li>
						<li><strong>Allsky Fans</strong> - Controls a fan based upon cpu temperature</li>
						<li><strong>Allsky Border</strong> - Expands an image to include additional borders </li>
						<li><strong>Allsky HDD Temp</strong> - Retrives hard drive temperatures using SMART</li>
						<li><strong>Allsky ina3221</strong> - Allows current and voltage measurements</li>
						<li><strong>Allsky influxdb</strong> - Allows data to be written to uinfluxdb</li>
						<li><strong>Allsky light</strong> - Determines light levels using a TSL2591</li>
						<li><strong>Allsky LightGraph</strong> - Displays a graph of day and night</li>
						<li><strong>Allsky ltr390</strong> - Measures UV levels</li>
						<li><strong>Allsky mlx90640</strong> - Captures an IR image of the sky (very experimental)</li>
						<li><strong>Allsky Publish Data</strong> - Publish Allsky data to Redis, MQTT, or REST</li>
						<li><strong>Allsky Temp</strong> - Reads up to three temperature sensors
							and controls a gpio pin based upon the temperature</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>New Settings</h4>
			<ul class="mediumPadding">
				<li><span class="WebUISetting">Images Sort Order</span>
					determines the sort order of the images on the
					WebUI's <span class="WebUILink">Images</span> page.
				</li>
				<li><span class="WebUISetting">Show Updated Message</span>
					allows hiding the
					<span class="alert-info">Daytime images updated every...</span>
					message on the WebUI's <span class="WebUILink">Live View</span> page.
				</li>
				<li><span class="WebUISetting">Nighttime Capture</span> and
					<span class="WebUISetting">Nighttime Save</span>
					are the same as the daytime settings but for nighttime.
				</li>
				<li><span class="WebUISetting">ZWO Exposure Type</span>
					specifies how images should be taken.
					See the documentation for a description of the different types.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Deleted Settings</h4>
			<ul class="mediumPadding">
				<li>The Image <span class="WebUISetting">Width</span> and
					<span class="WebUISetting">Height</span>
					settings were deleted since they are no longer needed.
					Use the crop and/or resize settings instead.
				</li>
				<li>The <span class="WebUISetting">Version 0.8 Exposure</span>
					setting was deleted since it's functionality is incorporated
					into the <span class="WebUISetting">ZWO Exposure Type</span> setting.
				</li>
				<li>The <span class="WebUISetting">New Exposure Algorithm</span>
					setting was deleted because it produced better results
					so is now always used.
				</li>
				<li>The <span class="shSetting">REMOVE_BAD_IMAGES</span> setting was
					deleted to keep people from disabling the check.
					In addition to "too dark" and "too light" images, images that are empty
					and corrupt are also checked for, and those images kept timelapses
					from being created.
					If you don't want to run the brightness checks set their
					<span class="WebUISetting">Remove Bad Images Thresholds</span> to
					<span class="WebUIValue">0</span>.
				</li>
				<li>The <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness</span> settings
					were deleted since there is no need for them.
					Changes to brightness should be done via the
					<span class="WebUISetting">Target Mean</span> settings.
				</li>
				<li>(ZWO only) The <span class="WebUISetting">Offset</span> setting
					was deleted.  It brightened every pixel by the amount specified
					and is not needed with allsky cameras.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><code>ASI_ERROR_TIMEOUT</code> messages are mostly gone.
					<b>Yea!!!</b>
				</li>
				<li>The ROI selection code assumed the captured image was always a jpg. It now 
					looks in the settings to determine the correct image name. See 
					<a href="https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky/pull/3337" target="_blank" allsky="true" external="true">Ensure the ROI editor uses the correct image</a>
				</li>
				<li>Date formats in the overlay editor are now working correctly</li>			
			</ul>

			<h4>Maintenance</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>All setting names are now lowercase and boolean settings are
					"true" and "false" rather than 1 and 0.
					These changes should have no impact on users.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>v2023.05.01_02 - Point Release # 2</h3>
			<details sub> <summary></summary>
				<h4>Enhancements</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The <span class="WebUISetting">Mean Threshold</span> setting now has
						separate daytime and nighttime settings.
					</li>
					<li>The installation keeps track of where it is so if you have to exit it,
						for example, to update the locale, it resumes where it left off.
					</li>
					<li>The installation skips steps that aren't needed.
						This greatly decreases the time when upgrading from v2023.05.01 or v2023.05.01_01.
						It can also skip the reboot if possible.
					</li>
					<li id="sensorTemperature">(RPi on Bullseye only) You can display the sensor temperature by
						doing the following:
						<ul>
							<li>Add <span class="WebUIValue">--metadata &nbsp; /home/pi/allsky/config/overlay/extra/libcamera.json</span>
								to the <span class="WebUISetting">Extra Arguments</span> setting in the WebUI.</li>

			<h3>v2023.05.01_01 - Point Release # 1</h3>
			<details sub> <summary></summary>
				<h4>Enhancements</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>If multiple consecutive "bad" images are found,
						a warning image is now displayed saying how many "bad" images were found.
						A system warning in the WebUI is also displayed with instructions on what to check.
						<br>
						When Allsky starts it displays an "Allsky is Starting" image until the first
						good image is saved.
						Depending on your settings and the sky brightness,
						it may take many images before it gets a good one to save.
						The new warning image makes it obvious Allsky hasn't hung.
					</li>
					<li>In the WebUI's <span class="WebUILink">Editor</span> page,
						the buttons (e.g., "Save changes") are now at the top of the page
						and stay there as you scroll down.
						A new "Top" button appears at the bottom of the page after you scroll
						to make it quick to get back to the top.
					</li>
					<li>Selecting <code>Refresh</code> from the
						<span class="WebUISetting">Camera Type</span> drop-down
						can be used to change cameras of the same
						<span class="WebUISetting">Camera Type</span>.
						For example, replacing a ZWO ASI120 with an ASI290.
					</li>
					<li>Greatly sped up the installation process when packages are not
						already installed by using prebuilt binaries where possible.
					</li>
					<li>Changing to a camera that Allsky hasn't seen before will use the
						prior camera's settings that typically are the same for all cameras,
						for example,
						<span class="WebUISetting">Latitude</span>,
						<span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span>,
						and
						<span class="WebUISetting">Owner</span>.
						You'll still need to verify other settings like exposure times
						are appropriate for the new camera.
						<br>
						Changing to a camera that Allsky HAS seen before will
						use all that camera's prior settings.
					</li>
					<li>The installation only prompts for a new hostname if the current one
						is still the default "raspberrypi".
						The suggested new name is still "allsky".
						If the current hostname is anything other than the default the user
						already changed the Pi's name, so don't prompt to change again.
					</li>
					<li>Check at startup if the settings file is properly linked to a
						camera-specific file.
						When it isn't, changes to the settings won't be propogated during
						updates to Allsky or when switching cameras.
					</li>
					<li>ZWO only:
						<ul>
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">ZWO Experimental Exposure</span>
							is a new setting that will use the Allsky auto-exposure algorithm
							at night (assuming nighttime auto-exposure is enabled).
							Initial testing indicates this improves the exposure of nightime images.
							<blockquote>
							If you enable this setting, please let us know if it helps or not
							by entering a Discussion item in GitHub.
							<strong>We need the feedback.</strong>
							</blockquote>
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Target Mean</span> can now be specified
							for daytime and nighttime.
							This is the same as for RPi cameras - values range from
							<code>0.0</code> (pure black) to <code>1.0</code> (pure white).
							<code>1.0</code> is equivalent to <code>255</code> in the ${MEAN}
							variable in the <span class="editorName">Overlay Editor</span>.
							</li>
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Mean Threshold</span> can now be specified.
							This is the same as for RPi cameras and determines how close the
							mean brightness needs to be to the
							<span class="WebUISetting">Target Mean</span>.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>If there are multiple Wi-Fi interfaces, information on each one will be displayed.
					</li>
					<li>The WebUI now validates numbers.
						For example, entering <span class="WebUIValue">X300</span>
						for an exposure will produce an error.
						Hovering your mouse over a number's value will tell you if it
						must be a whole number or it accepts fractions.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="shSetting">REMOVE_BAD_IMAGES</span> would often flag dark,
						but "good" images as "bad" and not save them using the default
						<span class="shSetting">REMOVE_BAD_IMAGES_THRESHOLD_LOW</span>
						value of <code>1</code> (which is still a good default).
						<blockquote>
							If after installing this point release you are still getting a lot of "bad" images,
							do NOT disable <span class="shSetting">REMOVE_BAD_IMAGES</span> - instead,
							modify the <span class="shSetting">REMOVE_BAD_IMAGES_THRESHOLD_*</span> values as needed.
					</li>
					</blockquote>
					<li>The <code>s3</code> upload protocol now sets the destination file name to
						<span class="fileName">image.jpg</span> instead of
						<span class="fileName">image-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.jpg</span>.
					</li>
					<li>The <code>scp</code> upload protocol now uses the
						<span class="shSetting">REMOTE_USER</span> setting.
					</li>
					<li>Set the upper limits on the x and y spinner controls in the overlay property editors to the size
						of the image, previously these were hard coded to 2048.</li>
					<li>When adding a new variable to the overlay variable list it can now be selected without
						refreshing the page.</li>
					<li>When an image is moved out of bounds using the x and y spinner controls a red rectangle will be
						drawn around the image, the same as if it were dragged out of bounds.</li>
					<li>Fixed a bug when compiling on i386 platforms, due to a recent Pi OS change.</li>

			<h3>v2023.05.01 - Base Release</h3>
			<details> <summary></summary>

				<h4>Core Allsky</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>New camera support:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li>All ZWO cameras as of May 1, 2023.
							<li>RPi HQ and Module 3 cameras.
							<li>ArduCam 16 and 64 MP cameras.
							<li>The RPi "Global Shutter Camera" is NOT supported - high speed shutters aren't useful for
								allsky images.
						</ul>
					<li>"Mini" timelapse videos can be created that contain a user-configurable
						number of the most recent images.
						This allows you to continually see the recent sky conditions.
					<li>Installation improvements:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li>If there is not enough swap space configured you are prompted to add more.
								Doing this decreases the chance of timelapse creation problems.
							<li>If <span class="fileName">allsky/tmp</span> is not a memory-resident
								filesystem you are prompted to make it one.
								This SIGNIFICANTLY decreases the number of writes to the SD card, prolonging its life.
							<li>If a <span class="fileName">~/allsky-OLD</span> directory is found it's
								assumed to be a prior release of Allsky and you are prompted to have its images,
								darks, and other items moved to the new release.
								See the <a allsky="true" external="true" href="installation/Allsky.html">Installing /
									Upgrading -&gt; Allsky</a>
								page for instructions for installing this release.
						</ul>
					<li><code>scripts/check_allsky.sh</code> was added to perform basic sanity
						checking of your Allsky installation.
						Run it after you're done configuring Allsky to see if you have any issues.
					<li><span class="WebUISetting">latitude</span> and <span class="WebUISetting">longitude</span>
						can now be specified as either a decimal number
						(e.g., <code>-105.21</code>) or with N, S, E, W (e.g., <code>105.21W</code>).
					<li>Removed several settings from <span class="fileName">config.sh</span>:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li><span class="shSetting">CAMERA</span>: To update the camera type, use the new
								<span class="WebUISetting">Camera Type</span> setting in the WebUI.
								This is an advanced setting so you need to click the "Show Advanced Options" button to
								view it.
							<li><span class="shSetting">POST_END_OF_NIGHT_DATA</span> is no longer needed since
								Allsky automatically determines if you have a local Allsky Website, a remote one, or
								both.
						</ul>
					<li>New ftp-settings.sh variables:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li><span class="shSetting">REMOTE_PORT</span> specifies a non-default FTP port.
							<li><span class="shSetting">SSH_KEY_FILE</span> is the path to an SSH private key.
								When <span class="editorString">scp</span> is used for uploads,
								this identify file will be used to establish the secure connection.
							<li>The Secure CP (<span class="editorString">scp</span>) and Google Cloud Service
								(<span class="editorString">gcs</span>) protocols are now supported for file uploads.
						</ul>
					<li>The Wiki now points to files in the GitHub <span class="fileNamw">documentation</span>
						directory.
						A copy of that directory is also on the Pi and accessible via the Documentation link in the
						WebUI.
					<li>The Allsky Documentation has been <strong>significantly</strong> enhanced and expanded.
						Its goal is to be a single source for everything you need to know about Allsky.
						If you don't know how to do something, look it up.
						If it's not in the documentation, let us know.
					<li><span class="shSetting">AUTO_STRETCH</span> now works, and is documented with sample images.
					<li>Images can now be uploaded using the full <span class="fileNamw">image-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.jpg</span>
						name instead of the shorter <span class="fileName">image.jpg</span> name.
						See the <span class="shSetting">IMG_UPLOAD_ORIGINAL_NAME</span> Allsky setting in the
						documentation.
					<li>Many minor enhancements and bug fixes were made.
				</ul>


				<h4>WebUI</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The WebUI is now installed as part of the Allsky installation and <strong>must</strong> be
						used to make all settings changes.
						<blockquote>
							The <a external="true"
								href="https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky-portal">allsky-portal</a>
							repository will be removed as it is no longer needed.
						</blockquote>
					<li>New links on the left side of the WebUI:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li><span class="WebUILink">Overlay Editor</span> allows you to drag and drop the text
								and images you want overlayed on the images.
								This is a <strong>significant</strong> improvement over the old mechanism and lets you
								vary the font size, color, rotation, etc. for everything you add.
								You can use variables in the text which get replaced at run-time, e.g., the time the
								image was taken.
							<li><span class="WebUILink">Module Manager</span> allows you to specify what actions should
								take place after an image has been saved.
								For example you can add an overlay or count the number of stars or periodically control
								a dew heater.
								Users can develop (and hopefully share) their own modules.
								Full notes on how to <a allsky="true" external="true"
									href="modules/modules.html">develop modules</a>
								is included in the documentation.
							<li>The <span class=">WebUILink">Allsky Documentation</span>
								link accesses the documentation on your Pi.
						</ul>
					<li>Minimum, maximum, and default values are now correct for all camera models.
					<li>Required fields with missing data are shown in red with a message saying the data is missing.
						For example, <span class="WebUISetting">Latitude</span> is a required field.
					<li>New settings on the <span class="WebUILink">Allsky Settings</span> page:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Camera Type</span> is either ZWO or RPi.
								This replaces the <span class="shSetting">CAMERA</span> variable in the
								<span class="fileName">config.sh</span>
								file and also allows you to switch between cameras connected to the Pi.
								For example, if you have both an RPi and ZWO camera attached, you can switch between
								them using this setting.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Max Auto-Exposure</span> for day and night.
								When using auto-exposure, exposure times will not exceed this value.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Max Auto-Gain</span> for day and night.
								When using auto-gain, gain values will not exceed this value.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Auto White Balance</span>, <span class="WebUISetting">Red
									Balance</span>,
								and <span class="WebUISetting">Blue Balance</span> are now available for day and night.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Frames to Skip</span> for day and night determine how many
								initial
								auto-exposure frames to ignore when starting Allsky, while the auto-exposure
								algorithm homes in on the correct exposure.
								These frames are often over or under exposed so not worth saving anyhow.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Consistent Delays</span> determines whether or not the time
								between the start of
								exposures will be consistent (current behavior) or not.
								When enabled, the time between images is the maximum exposure time plus the delay you
								set.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Overlay Method</span> determines if the text overlay
								(exposure, time, etc.)
								should be done by the legacy program or by the new "module" system (see above).
								<blockquote>The default method will change to the module method in the next release of
									Allsky,
									and after that the legacy overlay method will be removed.
								</blockquote>
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Require WebUI Login</span> specifies whether
								or not the WebUI should require you to login.
								Only set this to <span class="WebUIValue">No</span>
								if your Pi is on a local network and you trust everyone on the network.
								<strong>Do NOT disable it if your Pi is accessible via the Internet!</strong>
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Cooling</span> and <span class="WebUISetting">Target
									Temp.</span>
								(ZWO only) now have separate settings for day and night.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Aggression</span> (ZWO only)
								determines how much of a calculated exposure change should be applied.
								This helps smooth out brightness changes, for example, when a car's headlights appear in
								one frame.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Gamma</span> (ZWO only) changes the contrast of an image.
								It is only supported by a few cameras; for those that don't,
								the <span class="shSetting">AUTO_STRETCH</span> setting can produce a similar effect.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Offset</span> (ZWO only)
								adds about 1/10th the specified amount to each pixel's brightness,
								thereby brightening the whole image.
								etting this too high causes the image to turn gray.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Contrast</span> and
								<span class="WebUISetting">Sharpness</span>(RPi only).
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Extra Parameters</span> (RPi only) replaces the
								<span class="shSetting">CAPTURE_EXTRA_PARAMETERS</span>
								variable in the <span class="fileName">config.sh</span> file,
								and allows you to pass parameters to the <code>libcamera-still</code>
								image capture program that Allsky doesn't natively support, such as auto-focus options.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Mean Target</span> (RPi only) for day and night.
								This specifies the mean target brightness (0.0 (pure black) to
								1.0 (pure white)) when in auto-exposure mode.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Mean Threshold</span> (RPi only).
								This specifies how close the actual mean brightness must be to the
								<span class="WebUISetting">Mean Target</span>.
								For example, if <span class="WebUISetting">Mean Target<span> is 0.5 and
										<span class="WebUISetting">Mean Threshold<span> is 0.1,
												the actual mean can vary between 0.4 and 0.6 (0.5 +/- 0.1).
							<li>The <span class="WebUISetting">Focus Metric</span> setting is now available for ZWO
								cameras.
								Higher numbers indicate better focus.
								Use only when sky conditions are NOT changing.
						</ul>
					<li><strong>NOTE</strong>: the following settings moved from
						<span class="fileName">config.sh</span> to the WebUI,
						and are "advanced" options so you'll need to click the "Show Advanced Options" button to see
						them:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li><span class="shSetting">DAYTIME_CAPTURE</span> is now
								<span class="WebUISetting">Take Daytime Images</span> in the WebUI.
							<li><span class="shSetting">DAYTIME_SAVE</span> is
								<span class="WebUISetting">Save Daytime Images</span>.
							<li><span class="shSetting">DARK_CAPTURE</span> is
								<span class="WebUISetting">Take Dark Frames</span>.
							<li><span class="shSetting">DARK_FRAME_SUBTRACTION</span> is
								<span class="WebUISetting">Use Dark Frames</span>.
						</ul>
					<li> <span class="WebUISetting">Debug Level</span> is more consistent:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li> 0: errors only.
							<li> 1: level 0 plus warnings and messages about taking and saving pictures. This is the
								default.
							<li> 2: level 1 plus details on images captured, sleep messages and the like.
							<li> 3: level 2 plus time to save image, details on exposure settings and capture retries,
								and module execution.
							<li> 4: lots of gory details for developers only.
						</ul>
					<li> System messages appear at the top of the WebUI whenever you need to take an action.
					<li> Many minor enhancements were made.
				</ul>


				<h4>Allsky Website</h4>
				<ul>
					<li> The Allsky Website is now installed in
						<span class="fileName">~/allsky/html/allsky</span>.
					<li> If an older version of the Website is found during Website installation you'll be prompted
						to have its images and settings moved to the new location.
					<li> The home page can be customized:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li> You can specify the order, contents, look, and style of the icons on the left side.
								You can also hide an icon or display a new one.
							<li> You can specify the order, contents, and style of the popout that appears on the right
								side.
								For example, you can add a link to pictures of your allsky camera.
							<li> You can set a background image.
							<li> You can easily change the maximum width of the image.
							<li> You can add a link to a personal website.
								This link appears at the top of the page.
							<li> You can add a border around the image to have it stand out on the page.
							<li> You can hide the "Make Your Own" link on the bottom right of the page.
							<li> You can change the icon that appears on the browser's tab.
							<li> See the Allsky Website documentation for other customizations you can make.
						</ul>
					<li> Left sidebar:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li> The constellation overlay icon (Casseopeia icon) is hidden by default and should only
								be displayed
								after you've set the overlay to match your stars.
							<li> If you are creating mini-timelapse videos, when you install the Website an icon for the
								current video will appear on the left side.
								You can also manually show/hide the icon.
							<li> There's a new icon to display the image full-size.
							<li> The startrails and information icons were updated.
						</ul>
					<li> Popout on right side:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li> A link to your <strong>Image Settings</strong> can optionally be displayed via the
								<span class="WebUISetting">Display Settings</span> option in the WebUI.
							<li> The version of Allsky and the Allsky Website are displayed.
						</ul>
					<li> Timelapse video thumbnails are now created by default on the Pi and uploaded to a remote
						server.
						This resolves issues with remote servers that don't support creating thumbnails.
						See the <span class="shSetting">TIMELAPSE_UPLOAD_THUMBNAIL</span> setting.
					<li> Configuration file changes:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li> The two prior configuration files (<span class="fileName">config.js</span> and
								<span class="fileName">virtualsky.json</span>) are replaced by <span
									class="fileName">configuration.json</span>.
							<li> There are several new settings, including the ability to specify the opacity of the
								overlay.
							<li> The <span class="editorSetting">overlaySize</span> setting,
								which defined both the width and the height of the constellation overlay, was split into
								<span class="editorSetting">overlayWidth</span> and <span
									class="editorSetting">overlayHeight</span>.
								Having separate values can be helpful when trying to get the overlay to line up with the
								actual stars.
							<li> The WebUI <span class="WebUILink">Editor</span> page must be used to edit the Allsky
								Website's
								configuration file since it performs various checks before updating the configuration.
							<li> The <span class="WebUILink">Editor</span> page should also be used to edit a REMOTE
								Allsky Website's configuration file for the same reason.s
								A master copy of the remote server's <span class="fileName">configuration.json</span>
								is kept on the Pi and automatically re-uploaded to the server after every change.
								After you do this, the drop-down list on the <span class="WebUILink">Editor</span> page
								will now have
								<span class="fileName">configuration.json (remote Allsky Website)</span> to distinguish
								it from a local Website's file.
								See the Allsky Website Installation documentation for details.
						</ul>

		<h2>v2022.03.01</h2>
		<details> <summary></summary>
			<ul class="minimalPadding">
				<li>Switched to date-based release names.
				<li>Added ability to have your allsky camera added to the
					<a external="true" href="http://www.thomasjacquin.com/allsky-map">Allsky Map</a> by configuring
					<a external="true"
						href="https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky/wiki/allsky-Settings/_edit#map-settings">these
						settings</a>.
					Added <strong>Allsky Map Setup</strong> section to the WebUI to configure the map settings.
					The <span class="WebUISetting">Lens</span> field now shows in the popout on the Allsky Website
					(if installed).
				<li>Significantly enhanced Wiki - more pages and more information on existing pages.
					All known issues are described there as well as fixes / workarounds.
				<li>Added an option to keograms to make them full width, even if few images were used in creating
					the keogram.
					In <span class="fileName">config.sh</span>, set <span
						class="shSetting">KEOGRAM_EXTRA_PARAMETERS="--image-expand"</span>.
				<li>Added/changed/deleted settings (in <span class="fileName">config.sh</span> unless otherwise
					noted):
					<ul class="minimalPadding">
						<li>Added <span class="shSetting">WEBUI_DATA_FILES</span> - contains the name of one or more
							files that contain information to
							be added to the WebUI's <span class="WebUILink">System</span> page.
							See <a external="true"
								href="https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky/wiki/WEBUI_DATA_FILES">this Wiki
								page</a> for more information.
						<li>Renamed <span class="shSetting">NIGHTS_TO_KEEP</span> to <span
								class="shSetting">DAYS_TO_KEEP</span> since it determines
							how many days of data to keep, not just nighttime data.
							If blank (<code>""</code>), ALL days' data are kept.
						<li>Deleted <span class="shSetting">AUTO_DELETE</span> - its functionality is now in <span
								class="shSetting">DAYS_TO_KEEP</span>.
							<span class="shSetting">DAYS_TO_KEEP=""</span> is similar to the old <span
								class="shSetting">AUTO_DELETE=false</span>.
						<li>Added <span class="shSetting">WEB_DAYS_TO_KEEP</span> - specifies how many days of
							Allsky Website images and
							videos to keep, if the website is installed on your Pi.
						<li>Added <span class="shSetting">WEB_IMAGE_DIR</span> in <span
								class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span> to allow the
							images to be copied to a location on your Pi (usually the Allsky Website) as well as
							being copied to a remote machine.
							This functionality already existed with timelapse, startrails, and keogram files.
					</ul>
				<li>The RPi camera now supports all the text overlay features as the ZWO camera,
					including the <span class="WebUISetting">Extra Text</span> file.
				<li>Removed the harmless "deprecated pixel format used" message from the timelapse log file.
					That message only confused people.
				<li>Improved the auto-exposure for RPi cameras.
				<li>Made numerous changes to the ZWO and RPi camera's code that will make it easier to maintain and
					add new features in the future.
				<li>If Allsky is stopped or restarted while a file is being uploaded to a remote server,
					the upload continues, eliminating cases where a temporary file would be left on the server.
				<li>Decreased other cases where temporary files would be left on remote servers during uploads.
					Also, uploads now perform additional error checking to help in debugging.
				<li>Only one upload can now be done at a time.
					Any additional uploads display a message in the log file and then exit.
					This should eliminate (or signifiantly decrease) cases where a file is overwritten or not found,
					resulting in an error message or a temporary file left on the server.
				<li>Added a <code>--debug</code> option to <code>allsky/scripts/upload.sh</code> to aid in debugging
					uploads.
				<li>Upload log files are only created if there was an error; this saves writes to SD cards.
				<li>The <code>removeBadImages.sh</code> script also only creates a log file if there was an error,
					which saves one write to the SD card <em>for every image</em>.
				<li>Allsky now stops with an error message on unrecoverable errors (e.g., no camera found).
					It used to keep restarting and failing forever.
				<li>More meaningful messages are displayed as images.
					For example, in most cases "<strong>ERROR. See /var/log/allsky.log</strong>" messages have been
					replaced
					with messages containing additional information, for example,
					"<strong>*** ERROR *** Allsky Stopped! ZWO camera not found!</strong>".
				<li>If Allsky is restarted, a new "Allsky software is restarting" message is displayed,
					instead of a "stopping" followed by "starting" message.
				<li>The timelapse debug output no longer includes one line for each of several thousand images
					proced.
					This make it easier to see any actual errors.
				<li>The <span class=WebUILink">Camera Settings</span> page of the WebUI now displays the minimum,
					maximum,
					and default values in a popup for numerical fields.
				<li>Startrails and Keogram creation no longer crash if invalid files are found.
				<li>Removed the <span class="fileName">allsky/scripts/filename.sh</span> file.
				<li>The RPi <span class="WebUISetting">Gamma</span> value in the WebUI was renamed to <span
						class="WebUISetting">Saturation</span>,
					which is what it always adjusted; <span class="WebUISetting">Gamma</span> was incorrect.
				<li>Known issues:
					<ul class="minimalPadding">
						<li>The startrails and keogram programs don't work well if you bin differently during the
							day and night.
							If you don't save daytime images this won't be a problem.
						<li>The minimum, maximum, and default values in the <span class="WebUILink">Camera
								Settings</span> page of the WebUI,
							especially for the RPi camera, aren't always correct.
							This is especially try if running on the Bullseye operating system, where many of the
							settings changed.

		<h2>0.8</h2>
		<details sub> <summary></summary>

			<h3>0.8.3 - Point Release</h3>
			<details sub> <summary></summary>
				<ul class="minimalPadding">
					<li>Works on Bullseye operating system.
					<li>RPi version:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li>Has an improved auto-exposure algorithm.
								To use it, set <span class="shSetting">CAPTURE_EXTRA_PARAMETERS</span>=<span
									class="editorSetting">"-daymean 0.5 -nightmean 0.2"</span>
								in <span class="fileName">config.sh</span>.
							<li>Has many new settings including support for most of the text overlay features that are
								supported by the ZWO version.
						</ul>
					<li>New and changed <span class="fileName">config.sh</span> variables,
						see the <a external="true"
							href="https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky/wiki/allsky-Settings">Software Settings</a>
						Wiki page for more information:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li><span class="shSetting">IMG_UPLOAD_FREQUENCY</span> specifies how often the image should
								be uploaded to a website.
								Useful with slow uplinks or metered Internet connections.
							<li><span class="shSetting">IMG_CREATE_THUMBNAILS</span> specifies whether or not thumbnails
								should be created for each image.
							<li><span class="shSetting">REMOVE_BAD_IMAGES</span> now defaults to "true" since bad-image
								detection is now done after a
								picture is saved rather than once for all pictures at the end of the night.
								This helps decrease problems when creating startrails, keograms, and timelapse videos.
							<li><span class="shSetting">IMG_PREFIX</span>: no longer used - the name of the image used
								by the websites is now
								whatever you specify in the WebUI (default:
								<span class="fileName">image.jpg</span>).
							<li>
								<blockquote>When upgrading to 0.8.3 you MUST follow the steps listed
									<a external="true"
										href="https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky/wiki/Upgrade-from-0.8.2-or-prior-versions">here</a>.
								</blockquote>
						</ul>
					<li>Replaced <code>saveImageDay.sh</code> and <code>saveImageNight.sh</code> with
						<code>saveImage.sh</code> that has improved functionality,
						including passing the sensor temperature to the dark subtraction commands,
						thereby eliminating the need for the
						<span class="fileName">temperature.txt</span> file.
					<li>The image used by the websites (default:
						<span class="fileName">image.jpg</span>)
						as well as all temporary files are now written to
						<span class="fileName">allsky/tmp</span>.
						<blockquote>If you are using the Allsky Website you will need to change the

					<li><span class="shSetting">CAMERA</span> type of "auto" is no longer supported - you must specify
						"ZWO" or "RPi".
					<li>Startrails and keograms are now created using all CPUs on the Pi, drastically speeding up
						creation time.
					<li>Installing the WebUI now preserves any website files (keograms, startrails, etc.) you have.
						This allows for non-destructive updates of the WebUI.
					<li>New script called <code>upload.sh</code> centralizes all the upload code from other scripts,
						and can be used to debug uploading issues.
						See <a external="true"
							href="https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky/wiki/Troubleshooting:-uploads">this Wiki
							page</a> for more information.
					<li>The RPi camera does much better auto-exposure if you set the <code>-mode-mean</code> and
						<code>-autoexposure</code> options.
					<li>The WebUI will now show the Pi's throttle and low-voltage states, which is useful for debugging.
					<li>Darks work better.
					<li>Many bug fixes, error checks, and warnings added.
				</ul>
			</details>


			<h3>0.8 Base Release</h3>
			<details sub> <summary></summary>
				<ul class="minimalPadding">
					<li>Workaround for ZWO daytime autoexposure bug.
					<li>Improved exposure transitions between day and night so there's not such a huge change in
						brightness.
					<li>Decrease in ZWO sensor temperature.
					<li>Lots of new settings, including splitting some settings into day and night versions.
					<li>Error checking and associated log messages added in many places to aid in debugging.
					<li>Ability to have "notification" images displayed, such as "Allsky is starting up" and "Taking
						dark frames".
					<li>Ability to resize uploaded images.
					<li>Ability to set thumbnail size.
					<li>Ability to delete bad images (corrupt and too light/dark).
					<li>Ability to set an image file name prefix.
					<li>Ability to reset USB bus if ZWO camera isn't found (requires <code>uhubctl</code> command to be
						installed).
					<li>Ability to specify the format of the time displayed on images.
					<li>Ability to have the temperature displayed in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or both.
					<li>Ability to set bitrate on timelapse video.
