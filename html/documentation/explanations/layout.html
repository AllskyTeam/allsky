<p>
When you install Allsky it put its files and directories in the
<span class="fileName">allsky</span> directory of the login you installed it with,
typically <b>pi</b>.
That directory is usually referred to as <span class="fileName">~/allsky</span>.
</p>
<p>
Ever wonder what all the files and directories are in the
<span class="fileName">~/allsky</span> directory?
Read on.
</p>
<p>This is a typical view of the <span class="fileName">~/allsky</span> directory:
<img allsky="true" src="allskyDirectory.png" loading="lazy" class="imgCenter imgBorder">
</p>
<p>
Notice the colors?
The <code>ls</code> (<u>l</u>ist file<u>s</u>) command displays executable programs in green,
directories in blue, and "regular" files in black.
</p>
<p>
Here's what's in the directory:
<ul>
	<li><span class="lsGreen">allsky.sh</span>
		<br>
		This is the program that's executed when you start Allsky.
		It calls the appropriate program to take the picture (see the next bullet).

	<li><span class="lsBlue">bin</span>
		<br>
		This holds all the binary files (files created by compiling source code),
		for example <span class="lsGreen">capture_RPi</span> and
		<span class="lsGreen">capture_ZWO</span>
		are the programs that read your settings and take pictures,
		storing them in the <span class="fileName">tmp</span> directory, described below.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">config</span>
		<br>
		Contains all the configuration files.
		<blockquote class="warning">
		Unlike past releases, you should <strong>not</strong> edit the files
		in this directory manually.
		</blockquote>
		<u>Some</u> of the files in this directory include:
		<ul>
			<li><span class="fileName">settings.json</span> is updated via the
				<span class="WebUIWebPage">Allsky Settings</span> page in the WebUI
				and contains the settings used to take images.
			<li><span class="fileName">config.sh</span> and
				<span class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span>
				are editied via the <span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span>
				page in the WebUI and contain other settings used by Allsky.
				<blockquote>
				The settings in these files will be moved to the
				<span class="fileName">settings.json</span> file in a future release.
				</blockquote>
			<li><span class="fileName">cc.json</span> (<u>c</u>amera <u>c</u>apabilities) and
				<span class="fileName">options.json</span> are created
				as part of the installation based on what capabilities your camera has,
				and determine what settings you see in the WebUI as well as their
				minimum, maximum, and default values.
				<br>
				If you change cameras via the WebUI, these files are re-created.
			<li>If you have a remote Allsky Website and configure it via the WebUI,
				a <span class="fileName">remote_configuration.json</span> file will exist
				that's uploaded to the remote server whenever you change it via
				the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> page.
			<li>Advanced users may have a <span class="fileName">uservariables.sh</span> file.
			<li>The remaining files are updated when you make a change in the
				Overlay or Module editors.
		</ul>

	<li><span class="lsBlue">config_repo</span>
		<br>
		This holds "templates" of the configuration files.
		Copies of most of these files are updated and stored in the
		<span class="lsBlue">config</span> directory during installation.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">darks</span>
		<br>
		This holds optional <a href="darkFrames.html">dark frames</a>
		which are used to decrease noise in nighttime pictures.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">html</span>
		<br>
		All the WebUI files are here, and if you have the Allsky Website installed on your Pi,
		its files are in <span class="lsBlue">html</span>/<span class="lsBlue">allsky</span>.
		The WebUI doesn't have any configuration version,
		but the Website has <span class="fileName">configuration.json</span>
		which is updated via the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> page.
		<br>
		The Allsky Documentation is also in this directory.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">images</span>
		<br>
		This holds all the daily images, keograms, startrails, and timelapse videos
		for as long as you have specified in the
		<span class="shSetting">DAYS_TO_KEEP</span> setting in
		<span class="fileName">config.sh</span>.
		<br>
		Each day's files are stored in a directory called YYYYMMDD, for example, 20220710.

	<li><span class="lsGreen">install.sh</span>
		<br>
		The installation script for Allsky.
		Also used to upgrade from a prior release,
		and to (re)run certain actions, such as setting the swap space.

	<li><span class="lsBlack">LICENSE</span>
		<br>
		Holds the Allsky license.
		People that plan to copy Allsky in part or in whole should be aware of the license.

	<li><span class="lsBlack">Makefile</span>
		<br>
		This is used during installation to create directories and binary files
		and perform other tasks.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">notification_images</span>
		<br>
		Holds all the images such as "Allsky software is starting up".
		There are both .jpg and .png files, depending on whether your image is called
		<span class="fileName">image.jpg</span> or <span class="fileName">image.png</span>.

	<li><span class="lsBlack">README.md</span>
		<br>
		A file containing information about Allsky.
		You'll normally view the Allsky Documentation via the WebUI's
		<span class="WebUIWebPage">Documentation</span> link instead of this file.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">scripts</span>
		<br>
		Holds all the scripts (i.e., programs) used by Allsky while it's running.
		The only ones you'd ever change are
		<span class="fileName">endOfDay_additionalSteps.repo</span>
		and/or <span class="fileName">endOfNight_additionalSteps.repo</span>.
		See the documentation on how they are used.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">src</span>
		<br>
		Holds the source code for the capture, keogram, startrails, and sunwait programs.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">tmp</span>
		<br>
		Hold temporary files, including log files, used by Allsky while it's running.
		The contents of this directory are usually cleaned out after a reboot.
		<blockquote>
		Other than the <span class="lsBlue">scripts</span> directory described above,
		this is the only other directory that you may need to look in,
		and that's typically only to troubleshoot a problem.
		</blockquote>

	<li><span class="lsGreen">uninstall.sh</span>
		<br>
		A VERY BASIC uninstallation script that hasn't been tested much.

	<li><span class="lsBlack">variables.sh</span>
		<br>
		Defines a lot of variables used by other programs.
		These variables define where various files and directories are.
		Super advanced users who want to put items in different locations can
		create a <span class="fileName">config/uservariables.sh</span> file
		to define their own locations.
		<br>
		Note that although this has a <span class="fileName">.sh</span> extension which
		indicates it's a shell script, it's colored in black which means it is NOT executable.
		This script is only included in other scripts, never executed on its own.

	<li><span class="lsBlack">version</span>
		<br>
		A file that holds the version of Allsky you're running.
		The installation script (and eventually the WebUI) compare this version to
		the one in GitHub to determine if an upgrade is available.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">website</span>
		<br>
		This directory contains the <span class="fileName">install.sh</span>
		script used to install the Allsky Website on your Pi or (to help with installing)
		on a remote server.
		See the
		<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/installations/AllskyWebsite.html">Allsky Website Installation</a>
		page for instructions on installing the Website.
