			<p><strong>Modules</strong> can be used to enhance images created by Allsky.
				Different modules perform different tasks,
				and the <span class="managerName">Module Manager</span>
				allows you to control which modules run and when.
			</p>
			<p>There are two types of modules:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Allsky Modules</strong> are developed and maintained
					by the Allsky team and are installed with Allsky.</li>
				<li><strong>User Modules</strong> are developed and maintained
					by other people and can optionally be installed
					and deleted if no longer required.
					<blockquote class="warning">
						User Modules should only be installed from the official
						<a external="true" href="https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky-modules">
						user-modules</a> repository using the directions listed there.
						Installing from other source can be dangerous.
					</blockquote>
					</li>
			</ol>

			Warning:
			<ul>
				<li>Some modules are shown as <strong>experimental</strong>.
					Before using these modules you should ensure that you are proficient
					in analysing Linux log files.
					Experimental modules can be unstable and as such may "break" Allsky.</li>
				<li>Some modules are designed to operate with external hardware,
					typically connected to the Pi's GPIO pins.
					Before attempting to use any of these modules make sure
					you have an understanding of interfacing hardware to the PI's GPIO.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Don't be discouraged by the above warnings -
				the module system is very flexible and allows you to
				customise Allsky without having to change any Allsky code.</p>


			<h1>Module Flows</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Modules are run within <strong>Flows</strong>
					which determine when the modules run.
					Each flow can have a different list of modules that are run
					and the order in which they are run.
					The different flows are listed below.
				</p>
				<details>
					<summary></summary>
					<p>The flows in which modules run are:</p>
					<ul class="minimalPadding">
						<li><strong>Daytime Capture</strong> - Modules in this flow
							are run after every daytime image is captured and initially saved.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Nighttime Capture</strong> - Modules in this flow
							are run after every nighttime image is captured and saved.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Day to Night Transition</strong> - Modules in this flow
							are run when Allsky switches from Daytime to Nighttime capturing per the
							<span class="WebUISetting">Latitude</span>,
							<span class="WebUISetting">Longitude</span>, and
							<span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span>
							you've defined in the WebUI.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Night to Day Transition</strong> - Modules in this flow
							are run when Allsky switches from Nighttime to Daytime capturing.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Periodic jobs</strong> - Modules in this flow
							are run periodically and are not related to image capture.
							Each module defines how often it runs.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The diagram below shows each stage of the capture process and how modules fit into it.

					<h2>Selecting a flow</h2>
					<div>
						<p>From the drop down list select the flow that you wish to amend.
							If there are unsaved changes for the current flow then
							you will be prompted to save them before switching to a new flow.
							The current day/night flow will automatically be selected depending
							upon the current time of day.
						</p>
					</div>

					<h2>Uploading a module</h2>
					<blockquote class="warning">Please only upload modules from trusted sources.
						All modules uploaded are done so at your own risk.</blockquote>
					<p>To upload a module it must be in a zip file with the same name as the module.
						For example, if you have a module called
						<span class="fileName">allsk_test.py</span> the zip file must
						be called <span class="fileName">allsky_test.zip</span>.
					</p>

					<h2>Enabling a module</h2>
					<div>
						<p>To enable a module drag it from the <strong>Available Modules</strong>
							column to the <strong>Selected Modules</strong> column
							and select the "Enabled" checkbox.
							The module will become active after the flow has been saved.
							You can set modules to be automatically enabled when dragging
							them to the <strong>Selected Modules</strong> column in the
							<span class="editorName">Module Editor</span> Module Options.</p>
						<p>Most modules require some configuration after they have
							been moved to the <strong>Selected Modules</strong> column.
							Clicking the
							<span class="btn btn-primary btn-not-real btn-small">Settings</span>
							button will display any configuration options for the module.</p>
					</div>

					<h2>Disabling a Module</h2>
					<div>
						<p>There are two ways to disable a module:</p>
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li>Drag the module to the <strong>Available Modules</strong> column -
								this will disable the module and lose any settings for it.</li>
							<li>Uncheck the "Enabled" checkbox -
								this will disable the module but retain any settings.
								This is the preferred method if you just wish
								to temporarily disable a module.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Setting the Module execution order</h3>
						<p>The modules are run in the order they appear in the
							<strong>Selected Modules</strong> column.
							To change the order simply drag the modules up or down the list.
							Modules
							<span style="color: white; background-color: #DF0000;">
								highlighted in red</span>
							can not be moved.</p>

											href="https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Temperature/MLX90614_rev001.pdf">MLX90614</a>
										to determine the amount of cloud cover.
										The MLX90614 is a non-contact Infra Red thermometer.
										It is used to measure the temperature of the sky and
										compare it to the ambient temperature.
										Generally the difference between the Sky temperature
										and ambient can be used to determine the amount of clouds.
										The exact theory for the calculations is beyond
										the scope of this documentation.</p>
									<p>Two different methods are available for
										determining the cloud cover:</p>
									<ol>
										<li><strong>Simple</strong> -
											The difference between Sky and ambient
											temperature is used to determine the cloud cover.</li>
										<li><strong>Advanced</strong> -
											Uses a polynomial model to correct
											the sky temperature reading.
											The forumale used in this method are derived from

								<p>A typical connection diagram for a Cloud Cover sensor.
									As mentioned above the
									process of detecting clouds is not simple.
									The basic principle is to measure the difference
									between the ambient temperature and the sky temperature.
									The ambient is fairly easy to measure but the sky temperature
									presents some problems:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Field of View (FOV) -
										A narrow FOV will lead to results just above the
										sensor whereas a wide FOV will have less sensitivity.
										The narrow FOV versions provide a more
										accurate reading albeit with a much narrower FOV.</li>
									<li>Moisture -
										Since the sensor needs to be pointed vertically,
										if any moisture from rain/snow sits on it then the
										reading will be inaccurate.</li>
								</ol>
								<p>The moisture problem is a little more difficult to
									solve and the best solution is to mount
									the sensor horizontally and use a reflective
									surface to reflect the sky onto the sensor.
									This allows the sensor to stay dry.</p>
								<p>Several environment variables are created that can be used
									in the <span class="managerName">Overlay Manager</span>:</p>
								<ul class="minimalPadding">
									<li><strong>CLOUDAMBIENT</strong> -
										The ambient temperature.</li>
									<li><strong>CLOUDSKY</strong> -
										The sky temperature.</li>
									<li><strong>CLOUDCOVER</strong> -
										A string, either "Clear", "Partial" or "Coudy".</li>
									<li><strong>CLOUDCOVERPERCENT</strong> -
										The percentage of cloud cover, only
										available when using the Advanced method.</li>

				<p>Several modules can make use of masks, which are used to "hide"
					areas of the image to improve the final image.
					For example, the <span class="moduleName">Star Count</span> module can use a
					mask to hide all areas of the image that may contain things that
					will confuse the star detection algorithm, such as local light pollution
					like a far away street light.</p>
				<blockquote>Masks must be created in image editing software such as
					Gimp or Photoshop.
					There are no tools available within Allsky to create masks.</blockquote>
				<details>
					<summary></summary>
					<p>Masks can also be used to clean up or hide parts of the image
						like buildings, trees, or anything not created by the lens.</p>
					<table class="module-settings vtop">

				<details>
					<summary></summary>
					<p>After Allsky has taken an image an initial copy is saved

						It's important that this process finishes before the

						If the module flow takes too long multiple save image processes
						will be running, and will start to cause performance issues on the Pi.</p>
					<blockquote><strong>TIP</strong> - When installing a new module
						ensure debug mode is enabled in the
						<span class="managerName">Module Manager</span> Module Options
						 and monitor how long the new module is taking and what

			<h1>Developing Custom Modules</h1>
			<div>
				<p>The module system is designed to be extended by developing custom modules.</p>
				<details>
					<summary></summary>
					<blockquote>
					Personal modules should be saved in the
					<span class="fileName">~/allsky/config/myFiles/modules</span> directory
					which you must create (<code>mkdir -p ~/allsky/config/myFiles/modules</code>).
					<br>This directory is automatically propogated to new Allsky releases.
					</blockquote>

					<h2>Python Versions</h2>
					<p>Modules are developed in
						<a external="true" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>
						and should use the latest version available for the Pi.
						It should be noted that whilst multiple versions of
						Python can be installed on a Pi it's best
						just to use the version that ships with the OS.
						Generally that may mean reinstalling your Allsky installation to
						get the latest version of python.
						Running multiple versions of python is beyond the
						scope of this documentation.</p>

					<h2>Contributing a module</h2>
					<p>There is a central GitHub repository that you can contribute
						your modules to.
						You do not have to do this but over time we would like to
						build this into a comprehensive library of available modules.</p>
					<p>If you wish to contribute your module then please:
					<ul>
						<li>Create a fork of the <strong>User Modules</strong> repository from
							<a href="https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky-modules"
								external="true">
								https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky-modules</a>.</li>
						<li>Create a new branch in your forked repository,
							calling the branch the name of your module.</li>
						<li>Develop your module and commit it to the branch.</li>
						<li>Create a pull request into the allsky-modules
							repo from your branch.</li>
						<li>The module will be checked and if all is ok will
							be merged into the main repository.</li>
						<li>If you need to make changes to the module after it's
							been merged then refork the main repo,
							create a branch from the master branch named as your module,
							then commit a PR to main master.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>The structure of a module is important so please use the
						following folder/file structure.</p>
					<p><span class="fileName">allsky_MODULENAME</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="fileName">allsky_MODULENAME.py</span> -
							The main modules code.</li>
						<li><span class="fileName">requirements.txt</span> -
							Any python packages required by the plugin,
							will be installed with <code>pip3</code>.
							If you don't need any additional packages don't include this file.</li>
						<li><span class="fileName">packages.txt</span> -
							Any aditional libraries required by the module,
							will be installed using <code>apt</code>.
							If you don't need any additional packages don't include this file.</li>
						<li><span class="fileName">README.md</span> -
							Markdown file with any special instructions required for the module.
							If there are none do not include this file.</li>
					</ul>
					<blockquote>When specifying python libraries DO NOT include <strong>numpy</strong>
						in ANY <span class="fileName">requirements.txt</span> file as
						changing the version could cause issues with Allsky.</blockquote>


					<h2>Anatomy Of A Module</h2>
					<p>A module consists of two key parts:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>The metadata variable</strong>
							defines everything the
							<span class="managerName">Module Manager</span>
							needs to run the module.
							This includes basic information about the module
							and the configuration options it requires.</li>
						<li><strong>The module entry point</strong>
							is the main function that is called by the
							<span class="managerName">Module Manager</span>.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Every module MUST import the <a href="#allsky_shared"><strong>allsky_shared</a></strong> module.
						This module is used to pass data from
						the flow processor to each module.</p>

					<h3>The Meta Data Variable</h3>
					<blockquote>Please refer to the Boiler Plate example module for
						more details on this variable.
						That example includes all of the available options.</blockquote>

					<h4>The argumentdetails Dictionary</h4>
					<p>A module may require that the user can set values for its paramaters.
						This is implemented via the "arguments" and "argumentdetails" sections.
						If there are any argumentdetails present
						then a settings option will be displayed in the
						<span class="managerName">Module Manager</span>.
						Clicking on the setting's option displays a dialog
						allowing the module's settings to be changed.
						The dialog is created automatically from the options defined
						in the "argumentdetails" section.</p>
