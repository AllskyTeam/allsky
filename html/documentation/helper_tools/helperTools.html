The WebUI <span class="WebUILink">Helper Tools</span> do what the name suggests -
they "help" you do something, often helping determine what settings to use.

<h2>Startrails</h2>
<p id="startrails">
The <span class="WebUILink">Startrails</span> helper tool
aids you in determining what <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>
setting to use.
</p>

<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Many people find the stars in their startrails images don't have trails.
This can almost always be fixed by adjusting the
startrails <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span> setting.
<br>
This helper tool allows you to specify multiple settings and then look at the results
and pick the setting that gives you the best trails without including too many
bright images.
</p>
<p>
This is a typical Startrails Helper Tool page:
</p>
<p>
<img src="startrails_helper.png" class="imgCenter"
	loading="lazy" width="75%" title="Startrails Helper Tool">
</p>
<p>
The following information is needed:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Use images from</strong><br>
		This determines what images on the Pi will be used to create the test startrails.
		Ideally you want to use images from a night whose startrails had no trails.
		<ol class="minimalPadding" type="a">
			<li>If you don't change it, images from last night are used.
			<li>If you enter a directory name that begins with a
				<span class="fileName">/</span> then that full path name will be used.
			<li>Otherwise the directory you enter is assumed to be
				in the same location as the daily images.
		</ol>
	<li><strong>Number of images in include in each startrail</strong><br>
		Pick a number of images to include in each startrails that is
		big enough that you'll be able to see trailed stars,
		but small enough that you won't have to wait an extremely long time
		to see the results.
		<br>
		Start with the default and adjust as needed.
	<li><span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span><strong> values to use</strong><br>
		This is where you tell the command what settings to use.
		Keep in mind that every number you enter will produce a separate startrails image
		so don't add too many number or else you'll be waiting a long time for the results.
		<br><br>
		The first number in the default list is your CURRENT
		<span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span> value.
		You will almost always have to <strong>increase</strong> your current value
		so each subsequent number in the default is larger than the previous one.
		The default values increase by <code>0.03</code>.
		<br>
		Once you are "close" you can run this tool
		again with numbers that are much closer together, such as <code>0.01</code>.
	<li><strong>Verbose output?</strong><br>
		Enabling this option displays summary information on each test startrails,
		including the number of images included and not included.
</ul>
</p>
<hr>
<p>
A typical output is shown below.
Note that no images were used in the first startrails with a
<span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span> of <code>0.30</code>.
This is probably because the moon is out on the right side of the image
so the overall brightness of the image is somewhat high.
</p>
<p>
The second image has trails but only 13 of the 15 images were used
so the ideal <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>
is probably a little higher than <code>0.35</code>.

<h2>Image Stretch</h2>
<p id="imagestretch">
The <span class="WebUILink">Image Stretch</span> helper tool
aids you in determining the best settings to stretch an image.
</p>

<details OPEN><summary></summary>
<p>
If you want to lighten parts of your image to bring out details
you can "stretch" your images.
The <span class="WebUISetting">Stretch Amount</span> setting determines how
much of a stretch is applied,
and the <span class="WebUISetting">Stretch Mid Point</span> determines WHERE the
stretch is applied - to the dark parts of an image, the mid-gray parts, the light parts,
or anything in between.
<br>
This helper tool allows you to specify multiple settings and then
look at the results.
</p>
<p>
This is a typical Image Stretch Helper Tool page:
</p>
<p>
<img src="stretch_helper.png" class="imgCenter"
	loading="lazy" width="75%" title="Image Stretch Helper Tool">
</p>
<p>
The following information is needed:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Image to stretch</strong><br>
		By default the current image is used.
		If you are running this tool during the day and want to stretch nighttime images,
		find a "typical" nighttime image to use.
		<blockquote class="warning">
 		If you are already stretching images the tool will display a warning.
		Find a non-stretched image to use - you don't want to
		stretch and already stretched image.
		If you don't have any non-stretched images, temporarily turn stretching off
		and wait until you have an image, then use it.
		</blockquote>
	<li><span class="WebUISetting">Stretch Amount</span><strong> values to use</strong><br>
		This determines how much of a stretch to apply.
		The default list is a good place to start.
		<br>
		Note that stretching images increases their noise,
		which you can see in the 4th image below.
	<li><span class="WebUISetting">Stretch Mid Point</span><strong> values to use</strong><br>
		This determines what part of an image is modified.
		Lower numbers modify darker parts of the image and
		higher numbers modify lighter parts of the image.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You'll probably want / need to run this tool multiple times.
Changes to the Amount are fairly obvious but
changes to the Mid Point can be very subtle and often need to be played with.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
A typical output is shown below.
<br>
Note that the first images has no stretch.
This is so you can see what the different settings do.
<br>
The last image has a Stretch Amount of 20, which is way too much.
