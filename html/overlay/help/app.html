                    <dd>Data is displayed by adding 'fields' which define the data and format to be displayed, currently
                        two field formats are available text and images.</dd>
                    <dd>Text fields allow textual data to be displayed and are dynamic, that is they can change between
                        each captured frame. Images are static and do not change between frames.</dd>
                    <dd>Text fields are either 'System' or 'User' fields. System fields contain data defined by the
                        AllSky software, such as the date or exposure duration. User fields conatin data provied by
                        source sother than AllSky, an example might be weather data. User fields replace the 'extra
                        text' feature in AllSky.</dd>
                    <dd>Text fields also support the use of 3rd party fonts. The editor has an inbuilt font manager
                        where you can upload your own fonts.</dd>

                <h4>Adding a simple field</h4>
                <p>Select the field manager and click the + button. The new field will be added to the overlay. Change
                    the 'field' to show the data you require. Be careful NOT to modify the placeholders </p>
                <h4>Creating a composite field</h4>
                <p>A Composite field is one that consists of more than one piece of data. For example if you want to
                    display the Date and Time using a single field then the following should be enteried in the fields
                    properties</p>
                <p>Think of it like the sprintf command in c. The 'Field' value specifies the data you wish to display
                    with placeholders for the actual data, the Format and Sample field contain comma speeraterd lists
                    that control the formatting and sample data for each field. The position in the list equates to the
                    order in which the fields appear.</p>

            <p>The overlay editor support additional fonts which are managed via the font manager. The Font Manager is
                accessed from the main toolbar.</p>
            <p>The font manager will display all availabel fonts, both system and user uploaded fonts. The system fonts
                cannot be removed but it is possible to delete user fonts if they are no longer required.</p>
            <p>The font manager ONLY supports fonts from daFont.com.</p>
            <p>To upload a new font first ensure that the current config has been saved then select the 'Add Font' button from the Font Manager. Find the font you wish to upload on daFont.com and copy the url from the brower. NOTE: The url will always end in .font</p>
            <p>Enter the font url in the dialog and the overlay editor will do the rest. If there is an issue installing the font an error will be displayed. If the font uploads ok then it will be available for use in fields.</p>
            <p>To delete a font open the Font Manager and click the delete button. If any field is using the font it will revert to use whichever font is set as the default in the overlay editor options.</p>
