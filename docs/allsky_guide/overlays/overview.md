An overlay is information that is added, i.e., overlayed, on top of each captured Allsky image. This often includes the time the image was taken, the sensor temperature, and the exposure length, but can include any other text or images you want.

## TL;DR

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :fontawesome-solid-bomb: **Yes**, there are detailed instructions for the Overlay Manager… but if you’d rather skip the homework and start clicking buttons like a caffeinated raccoon, go right ahead. It’s surprisingly hard to break anything.

    - Click the Variable Manager to add data to the overlay
    - Click the Image icon to add an image (use the Image Manager to upload new images)
    - Click a field to set its properties (font, size, etc.)
    - Click the Preview button to preview the overlay — Allsky must be running
    - Click and drag to select fields. Once selected:
        - Click the Group button to group fields
        - Click the Left Align button to align the fields
