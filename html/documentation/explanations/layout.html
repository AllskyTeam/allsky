When you install Allsky it put its files and directories in the
<span class="fileName">allsky</span> directory of the login you installed it with,
typically <b>pi</b>.
That directory is usually referred to as <span class="fileName">~/allsky</span>.
</p>
<p>
Ever wonder what all the files and directories are in the
<span class="fileName">~/allsky</span> directory?
Read on.
</p>
<p>This is a typical view of the <span class="fileName">~/allsky</span> directory:
<img allsky="true" src="allskyDirectory.png" loading="lazy" class="imgCenter imgBorder">
</p>
<p>
Notice the colors?
The <code>ls</code> (<u>l</u>ist file<u>s</u>)
command displays executable programs in <span class="lsGreen">green</span>,
directories in <span class="lsBlue">blue</span>,
and "regular" files in <span class="lsBlack">black</span>.
</p>
<p>
Here's what's in the directory:
<ul>
	<li><span class="lsGreen">allsky.sh</span>
		<br>
		This is the program that's executed when you start Allsky.
		It calls the appropriate program to take pictures.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">assets</span>
		<br>
		Contains files used by the developers in creating Allsky
		as well as images used by the <span class="fileName">README.md</span> file.
		You can ignore this directory.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">bin</span>
		<br>
		This holds all the binary files (files created by compiling source code),
		for example <span class="lsGreen">capture_RPi</span> and
		<span class="lsGreen">capture_ZWO</span>
		are the programs that read your settings and take pictures,
		storing them in the <span class="fileName">tmp</span> directory, described below.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">config</span>
		<br>
		Contains all the configuration files.
		<u>Some</u> of the files in this directory include:
		<ul>
			<li><span class="fileName">settings.json</span> is updated via the
				<span class="WebUIWebPage">Allsky Settings</span> page in the WebUI
				and contains most of the settings used by Allsky.
				This file is linked to a file that contains your camera type and camera
				model in the file name.
			<li>The <span class="fileName">modules</span> and
				<span class="fileName">overlay</span> directories contain the configuration
				files for the <span class="managerName">Module Manager</span> and
				<span class="editorName">Overlay Editor</span>, respectively.
			<li><span class="fileName">cc.json</span> (<u>c</u>amera <u>c</u>apabilities) and
				<span class="fileName">options.json</span> are created
				as part of the installation based on what capabilities your camera has,
				and determine what settings you see in the WebUI as well as their
				minimum, maximum, and default values.
				If you change cameras via the WebUI, these files are re-created.
			<li>If you have a remote Allsky Website
				a <span class="fileName">remote_configuration.json</span> file will exist
				that's uploaded to the remote server whenever you change it via
				the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> page.
		</ul>

	<li><span class="lsBlue">config_repo</span>
		<br>
		This holds "templates" of the configuration files.
		Copies of most of these files are updated and stored in the
		<span class="lsBlue">config</span> directory during installation.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">darks</span>
		<br>
		This holds optional <a href="darkFrames.html">dark frames</a>
		which are used to decrease noise in pictures.

	<li><span class="lsBlack">env.json</span>
		<br>
		This file contains private settings used to upload files
		such as user names and passwords.
		These settings are in a separate file so you can safely upload the
		<span class="fileName">settings.json</span> file to GitHub without exposing
		sensitive information.
		<br>The data in this file is updated via the WebUI.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">html</span>
		<br>
		All the WebUI and local Allsky Website files are here.
		The WebUI itself doesn't have a configuration file,
		but a local Allsky Website has <span class="fileName">configuration.json</span>
		which is updated via the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> page.
		<br>
		The Allsky Documentation is also in this directory.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">images</span>
		<br>
		This holds all the daily images, keograms, startrails, and timelapse videos
		for as long as you have specified in the
		<span class="WebUISetting">Days To Keep</span> setting in the WebUI.
		Each day's files are stored in a subdirectory called YYYYMMDD, for example,
		<span class="fileName">20240710</span>.

	<li><span class="lsGreen">install.sh</span>
		<br>
		The installation / upgrade script for Allsky.

	<li><span class="lsBlack">LICENSE</span>
		<br>
		Holds the Allsky license.
		If you plan to copy Allsky in part or in whole you should be aware of the license.

	<li><span class="lsBlack">Makefile</span>
		<br>
		This is used during installation to create directories and binary files
		and perform other tasks.
		You can ignore this file.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">notification_images</span>
		<br>
		Holds all the images such as "Allsky software is starting up".
		There are both .jpg and .png files, depending on whether your image is called
		<span class="fileName">image.jpg</span> or <span class="fileName">image.png</span>.

	<li><span class="lsBlack">README.md</span>
		<br>
		A file containing information about Allsky.
		You'll normally view the Allsky Documentation via the WebUI's
		<span class="WebUIWebPage">Documentation</span> link instead of this file.

	<li><span class="lsBlack">remoteWebsiteInstall.sh</span>
		<br>
		The program used to prepare an optional remote Allsky Website.
		This should only be run after viewing the
		<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/installations/AllskyWebsite.html">
			Allsky Website Installation</a>
		page for instructions on installing a remote Allsky Website.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">scripts</span>
		<br>
		Holds all the scripts (i.e., programs) used by Allsky while it's running.
		Several scripts can be manually executed for debugging purposes,
		per the documentation.
		For example running <code>testUpload.sh</code> manually can help debug upload problems.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">src</span>
		<br>
		Holds the source code for the capture, keogram, startrails, and sunwait programs.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">tmp</span>
		<br>
		Hold temporary files, including most log files, used by Allsky while it's running.
		The contents of this directory are usually cleaned out after a reboot.

	<li><span class="lsGreen">upgrade.sh</span>
		<br>
		<strong>Do not use</strong> - it's incomplete and for developer testing only.
		<br>
		When finished, this script will perform <strong>all</strong>
		steps needed to upgrade the existing Allsky to the newest version.

	<li><span class="lsGreen">uninstall.sh</span>
		<br>
		A VERY BASIC uninstallation script that hasn't been tested much.

	<li><span class="lsBlack">variables.sh</span>
		<br>
		Defines a lot of variables used by other programs.
		These variables define where various files and directories are.
		Super advanced users who want to put items in different locations can
		create a <span class="fileName">config/uservariables.sh</span> file
		to define their own locations.
		<br>
		Note that although this has a <span class="fileName">.sh</span> extension which
		indicates it's a shell script, it's colored in black which means it is NOT executable.
		This script is only included in other scripts, never executed on its own.

	<li><span class="lsBlue">venv</span>
		<br>
		You can ignore this directory.
		It holds Python configuration data used by Allsky.

	<li><span class="lsBlack">version</span>
		<br>
		A file that holds the version of Allsky you're running.
</ul>

<blockquote class="warning">
Unless instructed to by an Allsky developer,
you should <strong>never</strong> manually edit any Allsky files;
instead, use the WebUI.

<h2>File Explorer View</h2>
<p>
If you log into the Pi desktop you can use its File Explorer to view directories and files.
This is similar to Window's File Explorer so may be easier for people not familar with Linux.
</p>
Here's its view of the <span class="fileName">~/allsky</span> directory:

<img allsky="true" src="fileExplorer.png" loading="lazy" class="imgCenter imgBorder">

</div><!-- Layout-main -->
</div><!-- Layout -->
</body>
</html>
<script> includeHTML(); </script>
