<b>Uploading</b> a file means copying it to a different computer.
Allsky supports several ways to upload files including
<code>ftp</code>, <code>scp</code>, and others.
</p>

<h3>Testing an upload</h3>
<p>
After you've configured settings such as
<span class="WebUISetting">Server Name</span>
and
<span class="WebUISetting">Protocol</span>
for a remote Website or remote server,
run one of the commands below, depending on whether you are testing uploads
to a remote Allsky Website or a remote server:
<pre>
testUpload.sh --website
<span class="pl-c"> &nbsp; &nbsp; OR</span>
testUpload.sh --server
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This attempts to upload a file to the server,
and if it fails, it often tells you how to fix it.
</p>
<p>
If that doesn't help, look at the sections below for additional information.
</p>


<h3>Incorrect WebUI connection settings</h3>
<p>
A <strong>common mistake</strong> is having incorrect values for the
<span class="WebUISetting">Server Name</span>
and associated <span class="WebUISetting">URL</span> settings in the WebUI.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>A <span class="WebUISetting">Server Name</span>
		looks like <span class="WebUIValue">myserver.com</span>
		and is the address FTP and other file transfer programs use to connect to the server.
		<br>
		It is NOT a URL so generally shouldn't have "http", "https", or "/" in its value.
	<li>A <span class="WebUISetting">Website URL</span>
		or <span class="WebUISetting">Server URL</span>
		look like <span class="WebUIValue">http://mywebsite.com/allsky/</span>
		and is the address web browsers use to connect to the server.
		<br>
		It MUST begin with "http://" or "https://".
</ul>
See
<a allsky="true" external="true" href="/documentation/explanations/serverLocationToURL.html">
Mapping server locations to URLs</a>
for tips on what values to use for these settings,
especially if you get messages like "Not found" or "404".
</p>


<h3>Incorrect WebUI settings</h3>
<p>
The <span class="WebUISetting">Server Name</span>,
<span class="WebUISetting">User Name</span>,
and other connection settings in the WebUI for the remote Website or remote server
must be correct.
If YOU can't log in to the server, Allsky won't be able to either.
</p>
<p>
The directory structure for a <em>remote Website</em> must match the Allsky standard;
changing locations and/or names of files and directories will cause uploads to fail.
For a <em>remote server</em> you can use use any directory structure you want;
Allsky only writes to the <span class="WebUISetting">Image Directory</span> location.
</p>


<h3>Certificate-related errors</h3>
<p>
There are three main certificate-related error messages you'll see.
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Host key verification failed</b> &nbsp; OR
	<br><b>The authenticity of host 'xxxxx' can't be established</b>
	<br>
	These errors typically occur when using the <code>sftp</code> PROTOCOL.
	On the Pi, <code>ssh</code> to your remote server:
	<code>ssh -p 22 username@host</code>
	(replacing "username" and "host" with the appropriate values).
	The host will display a message and prompt for "yes" or "no".
	Enter "yes".
	This only needs to be done once for a given host.
	<br>The remote server now knows about the Pi.

<li><b>Certificate verification: certificate common name doesn't match requested host name "xyz.com"</b>
	<br>
	There are two ways to fix this:
	<ol>
	<li>Create a file called <span class="fileName">~/.lftprc</span> and add
	<code>set ssl:check-hostname false</code> to it:
		<pre>echo "set ssl:check-hostname" &gt; ~/.lftprc</pre>
	<li>Set the <span class="WebUISetting">FTP Commands</span> setting to
		<span class="WebUIValue">set ssl:check-hostname false</span>.
     	If you expect to execute <code>lftp</code> manually the first method is better,
		otherwise use the second method so all your configuration changes are in one place.
	</ol>

<li><b>Certificate verification: Not trusted</b>
	<br>
	Add <code>set ssl:verify-certificate no</code> to
	<span class="WebUISetting">FTP Commands</span> or the
	<span class="fileName">~/.lftprc</span> file as above.
</ol>
If your Pi's IP address changed, or the IP address remained but the
machine using the addressed changed, you probably need to remove the previous key from your
<span class="fileName">~/.ssh/known_hosts</span> file.
If the file has only one entry, simply remove it.
If the file has multiple entries, make a backup of the file,
then delete one entry at a time until you find the "bad" one.


<h3>Missing directories on the remote Website or server</h3>
<p>
Review the 
<a allsky="true" external="true"
href="/documentation/installations/AllskyWebsite.html">Allsky Website installation instructions</a>
or the 
<a allsky="true" external="true"
href="/documentation/installations/RemoteServer.html">Remote server installation instructions</a>
to determine how to create the necessary directories.
