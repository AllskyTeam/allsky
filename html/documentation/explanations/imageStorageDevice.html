<p>
This page describes how to image an SD card, an SSD, or an NVMe disk for use by Allsky.
(NVMe disks are only supported on the Pi 5 and above with an NVMe HAT.)
</p>
<blockquote>
In the instructions below, a <strong>storage device</strong> refers to
either an SD card, an SSD, or a NVMe disk
because the instructions for all of them are almost identical.
</blockquote>

<p class="morePadding">
The two main scenarios when imaging a storage device are described below.
</p>

<h2 id="install">1. New Pi or "starting over"</h2>
<p>
This scenario is used when:
<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li>you have a new Pi
	<li>you want to use a new storage device
	<li>you want to "start over" and re-image your existing storage device
</ul>
</p>
<details><summary></summary>

<p>
Do the following:
<ol>
	<li>Download the 
		<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/" external="true">Raspberry Pi Imager></a>
		to a PC or Mac.
	<li>Start the Pi Imager and choose your "Raspberry Pi Device".
	<li>Choose your "Storage" (where to write the operating system to - your storage device).
		If nothing appears in the list then the Imager can't find your device;
		make sure it's plugged in and your PC or Mac can see it.
	<li>Choose the Pi "Operating System".
		<br>
		Select the <strong>(Recommended)</strong> entry which is usually the first one.
		For Pi 4 and newer models, that will be <strong>Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)</strong>.
		For older models it will be <strong>Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy, 32-bit)</strong>.
		<br>Allsky installs many of the packages used by the "Desktop" version
		so we suggest installing it.
		<p><img src="PiImager.png" title="Chosing Pi OS" width="50%"></p>
	<li>Press "NEXT".
	<li>When asked to <strong>apply OS Customisation settings</strong> press
		<strong>EDIT SETTINGS</strong> and make these changes:
		<blockquote class="warning">
		<p><strong>Do not skip this step unless you enjoy pain!</strong></p>
		Skipping it means you'll need to make those changes after
		turning your Pi on the first time.
		Wi-Fi won't work so you'll need to use a wired connection to the Pi,
		or connect a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to it.
		</blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>GENERAL tab:
		<ul>
			<li><u>Set hostname</u>: <code>allsky</code>
				<br>unless you have multiple Pi's on your network in which case
				they must all have unique names.
			<li><u>Set username and password</u>: <code>pi</code> and whatever you want
				for the password.
			<li><u>Configure wireless LAN</u>:
				<br>it's MUCH easier to do this now rather than after your Pi is running.
			<li><u>Set local settings</u>:
				<br>This doesn't actually change the "Locale"; it just changes
				the time zone and keyboard layout.
				Allsky will prompt for the <span class="WebUISetting">Locale</span>
				during installation.
		</ul>
		<li>SERVICES tab:
			<ul>
				<li>Enable SSH - Use password authentication
			</ul>
	</ul>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Plug the storage device into the Pi and power it up.
After it boots, install Allsky and your favorite programs.
</p>
</details>


<h2>2. Use a new storage device but keep some files from the old device</h2>
<p>
In this scenario, you are using a storage device but
want to use a <em>new</em> storage device AND keep some files from the existing device.
Files like your Allsky images, darks, and configuration files are usually kept.
</p>
<details><summary></summary>

<p>
This is typically done because:
<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li>you want a device with more disk space
	<li>you want a device with better performance
	<li>your current device is physically going bad
	<li>your are seeing lots of strange behavior and suspect Linux files are corrupted
	<li>your current device is getting "cluttered" and you want to start over
		with a clean install
</ul>
</p>

<h3>You have a second storage device</h3>
<p>
The process is straightforward with a second storage device.
<br>
In the instructions below,
your current storage device is called the <strong>old device</strong>
and the second device is called the <strong>new device</strong>.
<br>
<ol class="minimalPadding">
	<li>Image the new device using the <a href="#install">instructions above.</a>
	<li>If the new device is:
		<ul>
			<li>an <strong>SD card</strong>:
				using a USB-to-SD card adapter, plug the USB end of the cable
				into a USB 3 port on the Pi
				(or USB 2 port if your Pi doesn't have USB 3).
<br><b>IS IT MOUNTED AUTOMATICALLY, AND IF SO, WHERE?</b>
			<li>an <strong>SSD</strong>:
				using a USB-to-SSD adapter, plug the USB end of the cable
				into a USB 3 port on the Pi
				(or USB 2 port if your Pi doesn't have USB 3).
<br><b>IS IT MOUNTED AUTOMATICALLY, AND IF SO, WHERE?</b>
			<li>an <strong>NVMe disk</strong>:
				turn the Pi off and connect the NVMe HAT and the NVMe disk
				per the manufacture's instructions.
				Turn the Pi back on.
<br><b>IS IT MOUNTED AUTOMATICALLY, AND IF SO, WHERE?</b>
		</ul>
	<li>The Pi should still be booted off the old device
		with the new device also connected.
	<li>Copy the <span class="fileName">~/allsky</span> directory on the <em>old</em>
		device to the <em>new</em> device in the same location.
		You may need to use the <code>sudo</code> command.
	<li>Rename the <span class="fileName">allsky</span> directory on the new device to
		<span class="fileName">allsky-OLD</span> using either the Pi desktop or the
		<code>mv</code> command.
	<li>If you have modules in the old device's <span class="fileName">/opt/allsky</span>
		directory, copy that directory to the new device using <code>sudo</code>.
	<li>Copy whatever other files you want from the old device to the new one.
		This normally includes files in your login's home directory
		<span class="fileName">~</span>.
		Don't forget hidden files that begin with
		<span class="fileName">.</span>.
	<li>Run <code>cd; touch OLD_DEVICE</code>.
		See below for why.
	<li>Shutdown the Pi and remove power.
	<li>Switch the old and new devices on the Pi.
	<li>Turn the Pi back on.
		It should boot from the <em>new</em> device with the old device also connected.
	<li>Run <code>cd; ls OLD_DEVICE</code>.
		You should get an error that "OLD_DEVICE does not exist".
		That's because it's only on the <em>old</em> device and you are now on the
		<em>new</em> device.
		<br>
		If you do NOT get an error that means you are still on the old device.
		Check your work.
	<li><a allsky="true" external="true" href="../installations/allsky.html">Install Allsky</a>
		and tell the installation you want to use the prior version of Allsky;
		it will then restore your saved images, darks, and configuration files.
	<li>When you are sure you've copied everything you want,
		remove the <em>old</em> device.
</ol>

<h3>You only have <strong>one</strong> storage device</h3>
<p>
If you don't have a second storage device,
consider getting one and use the instructions above.
<br>
If you can't obtain a second storage device, do the following:
<ol class="minimalPadding">
	<li>Copy <span class="fileName">~/allsky</span> plus any other
		files, images, etc. you want to keep from your SD card to a
		USB drive, PC, Mac, or another device.
		<br>If you have modules in <span class="fileName">/opt/allsky</span>,
		copy that directory as well.
		Suggestion: name its backup directory
		<span class="fileName">opt-allsky</span>,
	<li>Shutdown the Pi and remove power.
	<li>Remove the storage device from the Pi.
	<li>Image the storage device using the
		<a href="#install">instructions above.</a>
	<li>Plug the newly-imaged device back into your Pi and turn it on.
	<li>Restore your files to the storage device.
		<br>
		Copy the saved <span class="fileName">~/allsky</span> directory to
		<span class="fileName">~/allsky-OLD</span> on the newly-imaged device.
		<br>If you saved <span class="fileName">/opt/allsky</span>,
		copy that directory to the newly-imaged storage device using <code>sudo</code>.
	<li><a allsky="true" external="true" href="../installations/allsky.html">Install Allsky</a>
		and tell the installation you want to use the prior version of Allsky;
		it will then restore your saved images, darks, and configuration files.
</ol>
