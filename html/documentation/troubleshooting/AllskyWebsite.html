This page lists various issues you may have with the Allsky Website and how to solve them.
<p>

<h2>WARNING: sunset is XX days old. Check Allsky log file if 'postData.sh' has been running...</h2>
<p>
If you have a local or remote Allsky Website, at the end of every night
Allsky calls <code>postData.sh</code> to upload a small file called
<span class="fileName">data.json</span> to the Website(s).
This file contains the sunset time and other information needed by the Website.
</p>
If you are seeing the message above when you go to the Allsky Website in a browser,
try running the command manually:
<pre>cd ~/allsky/scripts
./postData.sh</pre>

There will be no output on success.
If you see an error message and it's not obvious what it means, run:
<pre>./postData.sh --debug</pre>
which will produce many lines of debugging output which may help you determine
where the problem is.
At a minimum, it will provide something to attach to any trouble ticket you enter.

<h2>ERROR: 'sunset' not defined in 'data.json' ...</h2>
<p>
Follow the instructions in the error message.
If this message continues to appear,
open a new <a href="https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky/issues">Issue</a>.
</p>


<h2>After changing the <span class="WebUISetting">Filename</span> in the WebUI you no longer see images on the Website</h2>
<p>
If you changed the <span class="WebUISetting">Filename</span> setting or its extension
(for example, from <span class="fileName">image.jpg</span>
to <span class="fileName">myimage.jpg</span>
or from <span class="fileName">image.jpg</span> to <span class="fileName">image.png</span>)
in the WebUI, this change should automatically be sent to your Website(s).
If that didn't happen, you must manually update the
<span class="editorSetting">fileName</span> value in
the <span class="fileName">configuration.json</span> file (local and/or remote)
via the WebUI's <span class="WebUILink">Editor</span> page.
If that solved your problem, please
open an <a href="https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky/issues">Issue</a> per
<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/troubleshooting/reportingIssues.html">these instructions</a>.
</p>


<h2>Can't access the Website from a browser</h2>
<p>
If nothing appears when you go to the Website it's usually a settings issue.
If the Website is on your Pi, look in
<span class="fileName">/var/log/lighttpd/error.log</span> for clues to the problem.
If the Website is remote, ask your hosting provider if you can have access to the web server's
log file.
<br>
In both cases, you can also look at the <span class="fileName">configuration.json</span>
file in the WebUI's <span class="WebUILink">Editor</span> page to see if the
<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/settings/EditorColors.html">editor's colors are off</a>.
If so, that indicates a syntax error in the file that needs to be fixed.
</p>
<p>
If you are using the Pi's hostname in the URL,
for example <code>http://allsky/allsky</code>, then try using the Pi's IP address,
for example <code>http://192.168.0.21/allsky</code>.
</p>

<h2>Archived video files have no thumbnail</h2>
<p>
If you click on the
<i class="fa fa-lg fa-fw fa-play-circle"></i> "Archived Timelapses" icon on the left side of the
Website and one or more videos say "No Thumbnail", see below.
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 5em">
<h3>On your Pi</h3>
This shouldn't happen on the Pi - it should automatically create the thumbnails when
you go to the archived timelapses directory.
Look in <span class="fileName">/var/log/lighttpd/error.log</span> for clues to the problem.

<h3>On a remote server</h3>
<p>
For security reasons, many hosting solutions disable the commands needed to create
video thumbnails.
</p>
<p>
To overcome this problem, edit the <span class="fileName">config.sh</span> file via the WebUI
and set <span class="shSetting">TIMELAPSE_UPLOAD_THUMBNAIL</span> to "true".
If you are uploading mini-timelapse, also set
<span class="shSetting">TIMELAPSE_MINI_UPLOAD_THUMBNAIL</span> to "true".
<blockquote>
Making this change will only create thumbnails for all <em>future</em> videos.
To create the currently missing thumbnails, do the following for each missing date,
replacing <code>YYYYMMDD</code> with the date in <span class="fileName">~/allsky/images</span>
<pre>
cd ~/allsky/scripts
./generateForDay.sh --thumbnail-only --upload --timelapse YYYYMMDD
</pre>
This will upload the thumbnail for the specified date.
