# Allsky WebUI ![Release 0.8.3.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release-0.8.3.3-green.svg) 
A simple, responsive Web User Interface (**WebUI**) to control an [**allsky camera**](https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky)
built with a Raspberry Pi and ZWO or RPiHQ camera.

The WebUI code is based on an older version of [**RaspAP**](https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui).


## Demo
A demo of the WebUI is available [**here**](http://thomasjacquin.com/allsky-portal). 

**Note**: Most of the buttons have been disabled for the demo.


## Update
This version of the WebUI is designed to work with Allsky camera software version 0.8 or newer.


## Installation
The installation script is documented on the [main Allsky GitHub page](https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky).

After you complete the WebUI setup, you'll be able to administer the camera by navigating to
```sh
http://your_raspberry_IP
```
or
```sh
http://allsky.local
```

The default username is '**admin**' and the default password is '**secret**'.  If your Pi is accessable via the Internet it is HIGHLY suggested you change the password.
