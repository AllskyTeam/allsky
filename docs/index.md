Allsky transforms a camera into a tireless, intelligent observer of the night sky — an automated system that watches, records, and analyses everything that happens above you.

Using a high-sensitivity camera, powerful Raspberry Pi-based software, and modular extensions, Allsky captures meteors, satellites, aurora, and passing cloud, 24 hours a day. Each frame is processed in real time to reveal events invisible to the naked eye — and every night becomes its own story told through data, images, and motion.

But Allsky is more than just a camera — it’s an ecosystem.
The web-based interface lets you monitor your system live, review captured events, design custom overlays, visualise sensor data, and automate your setup with a flexible module system. From temperature and dew heater control to star detection and meteor analytics, every feature works together in a single, polished dashboard.

Built by enthusiasts for enthusiasts, Allsky is open, extensible, and endlessly curious — a fusion of astrophotography, automation, and discovery.


!!! intro ""
    The Allsky Camera software was originally created by Thomas Jacquin, a developer and astrophotography  enthusiast based in Canada.

    Thomas released the first version of Allsky around 2018, designed to run on a Raspberry Pi with a ZWO ASI or Raspberry Pi HQ camera to capture images of the entire sky — automatically creating timelapses, keograms, and detecting meteors.

    Since then, the project has grown into a large open-source community effort on GitHub under the Allsky Team￼ organisation, with contributions from many developers and users:

    Thomas continues to be recognised as the founder and original author, while the Allsky Team now maintains and evolves the software collaboratively.

    The current maintainers are  
    - Eric Claeys - @EricClaeys  
    - Alex Greenland - @Alex-developer 

There are Three sections to the documentation

- **Allsky Guide** Information for installing, configuring, and running the Allsky software, including describing what various features like overlays and keograms are, and how to troubleshoot and fix problems.
- **Developer Guide** Information for developers on howto extend Allsky by creating custom modules
- **SDK Reference** Information for developers on the available libraries within Allsky
