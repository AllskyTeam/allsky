<p>
There are several settings that determine what an image looks like - how bright it is,
how colorful it is, and its color balance.
<br>
The WebUI lets you manually set those settings, or have them automatically set by the software.
</p>

<h2>Image Brightness</h2>
<p>
If you've every used a film or DSLR camera, you know the concepts of shutter speed and ISO.
With an allsky camera the shutter speed is called <b>Exposure</b> and the ISO is called <b>Gain</b>,
and they work together to determine the final image brightness.
If you take a picture at some exposure and gain, then half the exposure and double the gain,
you should get a second picture of the same brightness as the first,
but slightly noisier since increasing gain or ISO increases the salt-and-pepper like noise.
If you have a manual camera you can set the shutter speed and ISO to any value you want,
but what if your camera (or allsky camera) automatically sets those values
but you want an image that's brighter or dimmer?
In Allsky you can set the <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness</span>
to change what settings the auto-exposure algorithm uses.
</p>

<h2>Image Color</h2>
<p>
If your sky looks green instead of blue, your <b>color balance</b> is off.
This is also called <b>white balance</b> because it can be easier to
determine which way the color is off by looking at something white.
</p>
<p>
On color cameras you can turn on <span class="WebUISetting">Auto White Balance</span>
in the WebUI to have the camera set the white balance,
but you may not like the results.
You can also manually set the <span class="WebUISetting">Red Balance</span>
and <span class="WebUISetting">Blue Balance</span> to get a picture of your liking
(there is no <span class="WebUISetting">Green Balance</span> because you can adjust
the amount of green in an image by adjusting the amount of red and blue).
</p>
<p>
We suggest trying <span class="WebUISetting">Auto White Balance</span>
and if you don't like the results, turn it off and set the red and blue balance manually.
You can change the <span class="WebUISetting">Auto White Balance</span> and red and blue balances
separately for daytime and nighttime.
</p>

<h2>Saturation (RPiHQ cameras only)</h2>
Saturation determines how vivid the colors are,
from black and white to very vivid (usually to the point where the colors look unnatural).
To change saturation, use the <span class="WebUISetting">Saturation</span> setting in the WebUI.
The middle point is "normal" saturation, but you may like more or less.
If you want a black and white image, set the <span class="WebUISetting">Saturation</span>
to its lowest value.
