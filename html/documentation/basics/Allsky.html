This page is for people who are new to the Allsky software and
describes how Allsky works, what the various pieces are, and how they fit together.
Although it is not necessary to know this in order to successfully use Allsky,
it can help while troubleshooting and many people will find it interesting.
If you haven't already read the
<a href="../miscellaneous/nomenclature.html">Nomenclature</a> page,
do so now as many of the terms described there are used on this page.
</p>

<h4>What does Allsky do?</h4>
<p>
The Allsky software is used to control an allsky camera which takes pictures of "all the sky".
Once a picture is taken it is saved to disk and optionally processed and
uploaded to an Allsky Website
(either on the Pi and/or on a remote server running the Allsky Website software).
It can also be uploaded to a remote server not running the Allsky Website software.
At the end of the night, a startrails image, LINK, a keogram image,
and/or timelapse video can be created and uploaded.
</p>

<h4>How does Allsky work?</h4>
<p>
Allsky automatically starts whenever your Pi is turned on or rebooted.
It can also be started and stopped manually,
and is restarted as needed when changing settings in the WebUI.
When Allsky starts it checks a few things then executes a program to take the pictures.
That program is either <code>capture_ZWO</code>
or <code>capture_RPi</code>,
depending on your camera type.
The appropriate capture program uses the settings in the WebUI
to determine how to expose pictures, how long to wait between them,
when to switch between daytime and nighttime, and many other things.
<br><code>capture_ZWO</code> uses software provided by ZWO to control the camera.
<br><code>capture_RPi</code> calls the
<code>rpicam-still</code> program to actually take pictures,
passing it the exposure times and other settings it needs to properly take a picture.
Regarless of which program actually takes an image,
if the image isn't too dark or too bright, it's temporarily
saved in the <span class="fileName">~/allsky/tmp/current_images/</span>
directory on the Pi.
</p>
<p>
After the picture is initially saved
the capture program calls the <code>saveImage.sh</code>
program to process the image in the background,
then checks if a night-to-day transitioned occurred;
if so, the capture program calls <code>endOfNight.sh</code>
to create startrails, keograms, and a timelapse video as specified your the settings.
Either way, the capture program then sleeps until it is time to take the next image.
</p>

<h4>Image processing</h4>
<p>
The <code>saveImage.sh</code> program optionally resizes, crops,
stretches, and adds an overlay to the image per your settings.
If the image is to be uploaded, <code>saveImage.sh</code>
checks if it should first be resized,
then calls <code>upload.sh</code> to upload it.
If the image will be part of a mini-timelapse,
<code>saveImage.sh</code> check if there are enough
images to create a mini-timelapse;
if so, it is created and optionally resized and uploaded.
If not, the image is added to the list of images for the next mini-timelapse. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, if the image is to be permanently saved a copy of it with a name like
<span class="fileName">image-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.jpg</span>
is added the the current day's folder in  <span class="fileName">~/allsk/images</span>.
</p>

<h4>End of night processing</h4>
<p>
The <code>endOfNight.sh</code> program checks the
settings to see whether or not a startrails, keogram,
and/or timelapse video is to be created; if so they are created.
If those items are to be uploaded, they are.
Either way, <code>endOfNight.sh</code> then exits.
