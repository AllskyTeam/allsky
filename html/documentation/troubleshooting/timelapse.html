Timelapse video creation can fail for a number of reasons.
The steps below, which apply to both the daily timelapse as well as mini timelapse,
will almost always fix it.
<p>

<h2>Timelapse video is not created</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
First make sure the timelapse is enabled.
In the <span class="settingsHeader">Timelapse Settings</span> section of the
WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Allsky Settings</span> page,
check that <span class="WebUISetting">Generate</span>
setting for a Daily Timlapse is enabled;
for a mini-timelapse, make sure <span class="WebUISetting">Number of Images</span>
is <strong>not</strong> <span class="WebUIValue">0</span>.
</p>

<p>
If the timelapse is enabled you should see a message in
<span class="fileName">/var/log/allsky.log</span> like this:
<pre>
*** timelapse.sh: ERROR: ffmpeg failed.
</pre>
(<code>ffmpeg</code> is the command that actually creates the video.)
</p>
<p>
See if one of the first lines in the error message is either:
<pre>
/home/pi/allsky/scripts/timelapse.sh: line 294: 6546 Killed ffmpeg -y -f image2 -loglevel ...
</pre>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>OR</b>
<pre>
x264 [error]: malloc of size 38600544 failed
</pre>
<p>
These errors are almost always caused by not enough RAM memory and swap space,
or by having a large camera sensor (e.g., the RPi HQ).
</p>
<p>
To fix, do the following:
<ol>
<li>Decide if you need a full-resolution video.
	Most monitors only display High Definition (HD) which is 1920 x 1080 pixels.
	If your sensor size is larger than that you can decrease the timelapse
	<span class="WebUISetting">Width</span> and
	<span class="WebUISetting">Height</span> settings to 1920 by 1080,
	adjusted for the aspect ratio of your sensor.
	Decreasing these values will also make the video file smaller.
	Even if your monitor can display higher resolution than HD,
	do other people who will view your video have monitors that can?  
	If this doesn't solve your problem, do the steps below.

<li>If you saw the <code>Killed ffmpeg ...</code> error
	increase swap space (or buy a Pi with more memory).
	The Linux kernel will kill any process that is taking "too much" memory
	to avoid system issues.
	Click <a allsky="true" href="increaseSwap.html">here</a>
	for details on how to increase swap.

<li>Install <code>htop</code> via <code>sudo apt install htop</code>.
	It's great for checking <code>ffmpeg</code>'s memory use.
	Run <code>htop</code> in one terminal while running
	<code>generateForDay.sh --timelapse DATE</code>
	in another terminal to check on <code>ffmpeg</code>'s memory use.
	<br>
	If the number in the "VIRT" (virtual memory) column of <code>htop</code>
	hits a maximum of around <b>2900M</b> and the timelapse fails,
	adding swap space will <u>unlikely</u> fix the issue so you'll need to try one
	of the other workarounds.

<li>The <code>malloc of size ...</code> error is often caused by using a
	high resolution camera.
	The default video codec (<span class="WebUISetting">VCODEC</span>) setting
	is <span class="WebUIValue">libx264</span>
<!--- 4096 x 2304 is the max for Buster -->
	which has a stated maximum resolution of 4096 x 2304.
	However, the RPi HQ, ZWO ASI183, and other cameras have resolutions higher than that.
	If you saw the <code>malloc</code> error do one of the following:
	<ul>
	<li>Decrease the timelapse <span class="WebUISetting">Width</span>
		and <span class="WebUISetting">Height</span> settings.
	<li>Set the <span class="WebUISetting">VCODEC</span> setting to
   		<span class="WebUIValue">libx265</span> and set timelapse
		<span class="WebUISetting">Extra Parameters</span> to
		<span class="WebUIValue">-x265-params crf=30</span>.

		This video codec takes a <u>long</u> time to create a video
		(over 3 hours on a PI 4b with 1500 RPi HQ images versus about 15 minutes
		with <span class="WebUIValue">libx264</span>).
		Lower <span class="WebUIValue">crf</span> numbers
		(a measure of file compression) mean larger, higher-quality videos.
		Note that small changes to the number can result in <u>huge</u> difference in file size,
		for example, going from <span class="WebUIValue">crf=30</span> to
		<span class="WebUIValue">crf=25</span>
		can increase the video size by over <b>five</b> times.
	</ul>
</ol>

<h2>Timelapse video doesn't have the correct number of images</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
The number of images (also called "frames") in a timelapse video is
the number of seconds long it is (including fractions of a second) times the
Frames Per Second (<span class="WebUISetting">FPS</span>) you set.
Execute the following to determine how many frames are in a video file as
well as the length in seconds.
Ignore the <code>fps</code> number,
and replace <code><i>YOUR_FILE</i></code> with the name of your video:
<pre>
ffmpeg -i <i>YOUR_FILE</i> -vcodec copy -f rawvideo -y /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 | tail -2
</pre>
</p>
<p>
One cause for videos that are too short is zero-length files.
Apparently when <code>ffmpeg</code> encounters a zero-length file it quits.
To remove zero-length files for a specified day, do the following,
replacing "DATE" with the name of a directory in <span class="fileName">~/allsky/images</span>:
<pre>removeBadImages.sh DATE</pre>
It will take a while to run.
When it's done you can re-create the timelapse by executing:
<pre>generateForDay.sh --timelapse DATE</pre>
</p>
