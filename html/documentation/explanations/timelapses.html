<p>
A <b>timelapse</b> is a video that contains multiple still image and shows changes over time.
For example, you can watch the clouds move during the day or the stars move at night.
</p>
<p>
Allsky supports two types of timelapse:
<ol class="minimalPadding">
	<li><strong>Daily Timelapse</strong>
	<li><strong>Mini Timelapse</strong>
</ol>
Settings for both types of timelapses are in the
<a allsky="true" external="true" href="/documentation/settings/allsky.html#timelapse">
	<span class="settingsHeader">Timelapse Settings</span></a>
section of the WebUI's <span class="WebUILink">Allsky Settings</span> page.
Each type of timelapse has its own sub-section in the WebUI,
and there is a sub-section that applies to both timelapse types.
</p>

<h2>Daily Timelapse</h2>
<p>
You specify whether or not you want a daily timelapse automatically created via the
<a allsky="true" external="true" href="/documentation/settings/allsky.html#dailytimelapse">
	<span class="WebUISetting">Generate</span></a>
setting.
When enabled, a daily timelapse will be created (and optionally uploaded) at the end of night.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to <strong>manually</strong> create and optionally upload a
daily timelapse is via the <code>generateForDay.sh</code> command.
For example, to create and then upload a daily timelapse to any Allsky Website and/or remote server 
you have for July 10, 2024:
<pre>
generateForDay.sh --timelapse 20240710
generateForDay.sh --upload --timelapse 20240710
</pre>
This will use the settings specified in the
<span class="subSettingsHeader">Daily Timelapse</span> sub-section of the WebUI.
</p>
<p>
If you have a remote Website you'll most likely need to enable the
<span class="WebUISetting">Upload Thumbnail</span> setting
so the timelapse's thumbnail is created on the Pi and uploaded to the Website.
</p>
<p>
If your camera has a lot of pixels you may need to resize the timelapse
in order to decrease the processing power needed to create it and to reduce the file size.
If so, update the
<span class="WebUISetting">Width</span> and <span class="WebUISetting">Height</span>
settings.
Cutting each size in half is a good starting point.
</p>


<h2>Mini Timelapse</h2>
<p>
A mini timelapse contains a limited number of images and is constantly recreated
throughout the day.
For example, you can have a mini timelapse that shows the last 50 of images,
and is recreated every 5 images.
Note that every new mini timelapse <strong>replaces</strong> the prior one,
so there is ever only one mini timelapse.
</p>
<p>
You specify whether or not you want a mini timelapse created via the
<a allsky="true" external="true" href="/documentation/settings/allsky.html#minitimelapse">
	<span class="WebUISetting">Number Of Images</span></a>
setting.
If greater than <span class="WebUIValue">0</span>,
mini timelapses will be created (and optionally uploaded) containing
that number of images.
You can enter any number you want, but beware:
<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li>A small number of images will produce a very short video.
		For example, a video with <span class="WebUIValue">5</span> images will
		usually last less than a second.
	<li>A large number of images will take longer to create and depending on
		the speed of your Pi, could cause other things to run slowly.
	<li>On a Pi 4, try starting with <span class="WebUIValue">50</span> images
		and adjust as needed.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If <span class="WebUISetting">Number Of Images</span> is greater than
<span class="WebUIValue">0</span>,
a new mini timelapse will be created after the number of images you specify in
<span class="WebUISetting">Frequency</span>.
The smaller the number the more often a mini timelapse will be created,
and the more processing power needed.
Try starting off at <span class="WebUIValue">5</span> and adjust as needed.
</p>
<p>
Mini timelapses are not designed to be created manually
because some configuration files need to be updated after creation.
