The WebUI's <span class="WebUILink">Editor</span> page allows editing Allsky configuration files.
Items in the editor window are color-coded depending on what they are.
</p>
<blockquote>
HINT: The Editor accepts CTRL-Z to undo actions.
</blockquote>

<!-- A typical view of a shell file being edited is below, followed by a typical JSON file.
A description of the color scheme comes last.

<h2>Shell (.sh) Files</h2>
<br>
<a allsky="true" class="img" href="EditorPage-sh.png" target="_blank">
<img allsky="true" src="EditorPage-sh.png" title="Editing .sh file - click to show full version" alt=".sh file" loading="lazy" width="25%">
</a>

<h2>JSON (.json) Files</h2>
<br>
-->
<a allsky="true" class="img" href="EditorPage-json.png">
<img allsky="true" src="EditorPage-json.png" title="Editing .json file - click to show full version" alt=".json file" loading="lazy">
</a>

<h2>Color scheme</h2>
<ul>
<li>Setting <strong>names</strong> look different depending on the file type:
	<ul>
	<li>In <span class="fileName">.json</span> files they look
		<span class="editorSetting">likeThis</span>.
	</li>Settings names MUST be enclosed in double quotes,
		but quotes around them are omitted in the Allsky documentation for readability.
<!--
	<li>In <span class="fileName">.sh</span> files the names look
		<span class="editorShell">LIKE_THIS</span>.
		By convention shell setting names (called shell "variables") are all uppercase
		and multi-word names are separated by an underscore (<code>_</code>),
		although there are some variables that don't follow that convention.
-->
	</ul>
<li>Colors for setting <strong>values</strong> vary based on value's type:
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Text</strong> (anything surrounded by quotes):
		<span class="editorString">"sample text"</span>.
		Note that a number surrounded by quotes like
		<span class="editorString">"41.79"</span> is treated as text
		and is confusing to people looking at the value.
		If a value is supposed to be a number, don't add quotes.
	<li><strong>Numbers</strong> (when not quoted):
		<span class="editorNum">41.79</span>,
		<span class="editorSign">-</span><span class="editorNum">88.1</span>.
	<li><strong>Booleans</strong> (when not quoted):
		<span class="editorBool">true</span>,
		<span class="editorBool">false</span>.
<!--
		Note that in shell files these values are usually quoted,
		which means they are strings, not booleans.
		The shell has no boolean type, unlike JSON and many newer programming languages which do.
-->
	</ul>
<li>Special characters: <span class="editorSpecial">{ } : , =</span>
<li>JSON brackets: <span class="editorBracketsJSON">[ ]</span>
<!--
<li>Shell comments: <span class="editorShellComment"># This is a shell comment</span>
<li>Many reserved words and common commands in shell scripts
	like "if" and "sudo" have special colors.
-->
</ul>

<h2>Problems in the file</h2>
<p>
If there's a formatting error in the file a small red "x" will appear to the left of
a the line number.
Hover your cursor over it to see the error.
<br>In the example below, a comma is missing from the end of line 37.
The message is somewhat cryptic but is telling you it was expecting to see
one of the listed characters at the end of the line.
</p>
<a allsky="true" class="img" href="EditorPage-json.png">
<img allsky="true" src="jsonSyntaxError.png" title="Error in file" alt="Error in file" loading="lazy">
</a>
<p>
You will not be able to save the file until all errors are resolved.
</p>

<p>
If the page doesn't indicate there's an error
but you get an error when you try to view the page,
check if the colors on the page are different than what was described above.
The most common errors are below:
<ul>
<li>In JSON files:
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Missing commas</strong>
		are needed after each value except the last one in a sub-section.
		<br>
		<span class="editorSpecial">{</span>
		<br>
		<span class="editorSpecial">
		<span class="editorSetting">"setting1"</span>
		:
		<span class="editorString">"value 1"</span>
		</span>
			<span style="color: red">&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; missing comma</span>
		<br>
		<span class="editorSpecial">
		<span class="editorSetting">"setting2"</span>
		:
		<span class="editorString">"value 2"</span>
		</span>
			<span style="color: red">&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; last entry, no comma needed</span>
		<br>
		<span class="editorSpecial">}</span>

	<li><strong>Missing quotes</strong>
		- setting names and string values must be surrounded by double quotes.
		<br>
		<span class="editorSpecial">
		<span class="editorSetting">setting1</span>:<span class="editorString">"value 1"</span>
		</span>
			<span style="color: red">&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; missing quotes around name</span>
	<li><strong>Missing colons</strong>
		- one must separate each setting name from its value.
		There can be 0 or more spaces before and/or after the colon.
		<span class="editorSpecial">
		<span class="editorSetting">setting1</span>
		<span class="editorString">"value 1"</span>
		</span>
			<span style="color: red">&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; missing colon</span>
	</ul>
<!--
<li>Shell files
	<ul>
	<li>Missing quotes - strings that contain a space, tab, or special character
		must be surrounded by quotes.
	<li>Extraneous spaces - there should be no space between a variable name
		and the <span class="editorSpecial">=</span>
		and between the and the <span class="editorSpecial">=</span> and the value.
	</ul>
