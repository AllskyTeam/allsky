This page describes how to install and upgrade Allsky.
</p>
<blockquote class="warning">
Your camera must be connected to the Pi prior to installation.
<p>
If you have an RPi camera, run the following to make sure the camera can be seen by Allsky:
<pre>
libcamera-still --list-cameras
</pre>
If camera number <code>0</code> (the first camera) is in the list, you're good to go.
<br>
Note that some non-Raspberry Pi brand cameras may need special software installed and/or operating system
configuration changes - read the camera manual.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We highly suggest installing the current version of Allsky on a clean SD card
since a lot of files have changed and using a clean card will ensure a clutter-free environment
with the most recent commands.
<br>
See the instructions on
<a allsky="true" href="../explanations/imageSDcard.html" external="true">
how to image an SD card for use by Allsky.</a>
</p>

<h2>If a version of Allsky already exists</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
If you have an <b>existing</b> version of Allsky, stop it:
<pre>
sudo systemctl stop allsky
cd
</pre>
</p>
then perform <strong>one</strong> of these steps:
<ol>
	<li>To <b>upgrade</b> the old version and keep its settings:
	<pre>mv  allsky  allsky-OLD</pre>

	<li>To <b>save</b> the old version but not use it:
	<br>
	<pre>mv  allsky  allsky-SAVED</pre>
	At some point you'll want to delete the SAVED version so it doesn't use disk space.

	<li>To <b>delete</b> the old version -
		only select this option if you're sure you don't want any saved
		images, darks, and configuration settings:
	<pre>rm  -fr  allsky</pre>
</ol>
<p>
Continue to the <a href="#PreInstallation">Pre installation</a> section.
</p>
</details>


<h2 id=PreInstallation>Pre installation</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
The following needs to be done once prior to installing Allsky:
<ol>
	<li>If this is a new Pi, you'll need to
		<a allsky="true" href="../explanations/imageSDcard.html" external="true">
		install the Raspberry Pi Operating System (OS)</a> on it.
	<li>Make sure your Pi has a
		<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md" external="true">working Internet connection</a>.
		If you have a choice between a wired LAN and wireless WLAN connection,
		choose the wired connect - they are faster and more reliable.
		If you use
		<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#power-over-ethernet-poe-connector" external="true">
		Power over Ethernet (PoE)</a>,
		you can run a single ethernet cable to your Pi.
	<li>Ensure <code>git</code> is installed:
		<pre>sudo apt-get install git</pre>
</p>
</details>


<h2 id="Installation">Installation</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
The following commands put the new release of Allsky in
<span class="fileName">~/allsky</span>.
Except for some system files,
all Allsky-related files reside in this directory.
</p>

<pre>
cd
git clone  --depth=1  --recursive  https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky.git
cd allsky
./install.sh</pre>
<p>
The <code>git clone</code> command will take a couple minutes and should
produce output similar to what's below.
The new <span class="fileName">allsky</span> directory is approximately 75 MB after download.
<pre>

</pre>
<p>
The Allsky installation prompts for several items including:
<ul>
	<li>New host name, if not the default of <code>allsky</code>.
		If you have more than one Pi on the same network they
		<strong>must</strong> all have unique names.
		For example, if you have a test Pi you may want to call it <code>allsky-test</code>.
	<li><strong>Locale</strong> to use.
		This determines what the decimal separator is in log output
		(period or comma).
		<br>Note that the default locale is <code>en_GB.UTF-8</code> where the Pi is developed.
	<li>Adding <strong>swap space</strong> if needed.
		Swap space effectively increases the amount of memory your Pi has.
		Insufficient swap space is one of the leading causes of timelapse video creations problems.
	<li>Putting the <span class="fileName">~/allsky/tmp</span>
		directory in memory instead of on the disk.
		This directory holds temporary Allsky files and is where most Allsky files are
		initially written to.
		Putting the directory in memory <b>significantly</b> reduces the number of writes
		to the SD card, which increases its life.
</ul>
You should normally accept the defaults.
</p>
<p>
During installation you'll be notified of any actions you need
to take when the installation completes.
If there are any such actions, the first time Allsky runs after the reboot it will stop and
display a message in the WebUI (which you should clear when done performing the actions).
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
The installation <i>may</i> take up to an hour, depending on how many package
you already have installed and the speed of your Pi.
Subsequent installations of Allsky will be significantly faster.
</blockquote>
</p>
</details>


<h2>Post installation</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
After installation, reboot if told to,
then perform any actions the installation script identified.
Allsky will not begin until you do the following:
<ol>
	<li>Bring up the WebUI by entering
		<code>http://allsky.local</code> or
		<code>http://allsky.localhost</code> in a web browser.
		The default username is <strong>admin</strong> and the default password is <strong>secret</strong>.
		<blockquote>
		If your website is publically viewable you should change the username and password via the
		<span class="WebUILink">Change Password</span> link on the WebUI.
		</blockquote>

	<li>Go to the <span class="WebUILink">Allsky Settings</span> page.
	<li>Make any necessary and/or desired changes.
	<li>Click on the
		<span class="btn btn-primary btn-not-real btn-small">Save changes</span> button.
		Allsky will start.
</ol>
</details>


<h2>Starting and stopping Allsky</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Allsky starts automatically when the Raspberry Pi boots up.
To enable or disable this behavior, use these commands:
<pre>
sudo systemctl enable allsky     <span class="shellComment"># starts Allsky when the Pi boots up</span>
<span class="shellComment">#   OR</span>
sudo systemctl disable allsky    <span class="shellComment"># does NOT automatically start Allsky</span>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
When you want to manually start, stop, or restart Allsky,
or obtain status, use one of these commands:
<pre>
sudo systemctl start allsky
sudo systemctl stop allsky
sudo systemctl restart allsky
sudo systemctl status allsky
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
Tip: Add lines like the following to <span class="fileName">~/.bashrc</span> to save typing:
<pre>
alias start='sudo systemctl start allsky'
</pre>
You then only need to type <code>start</code> to start Allsky.
Do this for the other commands as well.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Starting Allsky from the terminal is a great way to track down issues as
it provides debug information to the terminal window.
To start Allsky manually, run:
<pre>
sudo systemctl stop allsky
cd ~/allsky
./allsky.sh
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If you are using a desktop environment (Pixel, Mate, LXDE, etc.) or using remote desktop or VNC,
you can add the <code>preview</code> argument to show the images the program is
currently saving in a separate window:
<pre>
./allsky.sh preview
</pre>
</p>
