- **Allsky** is the main program that captures and saves images and includes the Web User Interface (WebUI) used to administer Allsky and parts of your Pi. You can also:
    - When a page says "Allsky Software" or just "software" it's referring to the main Allsky software that's running on your Pi and resides in the ~/allsky directory.
- **Allsky Website** is a simple web interface that can run on your Pi and/or a remote server and displays:
    - This is often shortened to Website - always with a capital W.
    - A local Allsky Website runs on the same Pi that Allsky runs on.
    - A remote Website runs somewhere else. Allsky doesn't care if the remote machine is a true "server" or simply a 10-year old PC sitting under your desk. The Allsky documentation considers both of them a "remote server".
- **WebUI** is the Web User Interface used to administer Allsky.
- **Module** Code that runs during the image capture and processing pipelines
- **Extra Module** Code contributed by both the Allsky team and others that runs during the image cpature and processing pipelines
- **Server** A server, as in "remote server", is a computer that often sits in a datacenter and has a dedicated purpose such as hosting web pages or returning search results like Google.
