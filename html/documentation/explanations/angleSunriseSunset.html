<h2>What does the <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> setting do?
How is it related to sunrise and sunset?</h2>
<p>
The time the sun actually sets and rises at your location is
dependent on the day of the year and your latitude and longitude,
and defines what people call <strong>daytime</strong> and <strong>nighttime</strong>.
Allsky also has a <strong>daytime</strong> and <strong>nighttime</strong>,
but they determine when to use your daytime and nighttime settings,
and can be changed as described below.
<blockquote>
Don't confuse Allsky's <strong>daytime</strong> and <strong>nighttime</strong>
with your actual daytime and nighttime.
Allsky's version should really be called <strong>daytime settings start</strong> and
<strong>nighttime settings start</strong>.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Allsky's <strong>daytime</strong> is your actual sunrise time <strong>plus</strong> an offset you define,
called the <a external="true" allsky="true" href="/documentation/settings/allsky.html#angle">
	<span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span></a>.
This is set in the <span class="WebUILink">Allsky Settings</span> page of the WebUI
and is a positive or negative number that indicates the number of degrees
<em>above</em> (positive) or <em>below</em> (negative) the horizon the Sun is when daytime starts.
</p>
<p>
Allsky's <strong>nighttime</strong> is your actual sunset time <strong>minus</strong>
the <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span>.
</p>
<p>
As an example, assume the Sun rises at 7:00 AM and sets at 18:00 (6:00 PM).
Using an <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> of <span class="WebUIValue">0</span> degrees,
Allsky's daytime starts at 7:00 and nighttime starts at 18:00,
and that's when Allsky will start using your daytime and nightttime settings, respectively.
</p>

<p>
The Sun moves at 15 degrees per hour, so 6 degrees
is 24 minutes (6 degrees / 15 degrees * 60 minutes).
<br>Remember: daytime ADDs the number of minutes represented by
<span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> and nighttime SUBTRACTs it.
<br>Subtracting a <em>negative</em> number is the same as adding a <em>positive</em> number,
so 100 MINUS -5 is the same as 100 PLUS 5.
</p>

<p>
Using an <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> of <span class="WebUIValue">6</span> degrees,
Allsky's daytime starts at 7:24 (7:00 PLUS 24 minutes)
and nighttime at 17:36 (18:00 MINUS 24 minutes).
An <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> of <span class="WebUIValue">-6</span>
degrees would give 6:36 (7:00 PLUS -24 minutes)
and 18:24 (18:00 MINUS -24 minutes).
The <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> effectively determines the length of daytime - the
larger the <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> the shorter the daytime.
</p>

<h4>Why is Angle important?</h4>
<p>
You tell Allsky when to start using your daytime settings and nighttime settings
by adjusting your <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span>.
<!--
<p>
Astrophotographers rarely start taking pictures at sunset since it's still too light.
Instead, they start taking pictures when it's much darker, often one of the following times:
<ul>
<li><b>Civil Twilight</b> goes from sunset to when the Sun is 6 degrees below the horizon
	(i.e., <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> of <span class="WebUIValue">-6</span>),
	and ends when the Sun is coming up and is 6 degrees below the horizon.
	This is 24 minutes after sunset through 24 minutes before sunrise.
	It is still fairly light at Civil Twilight.
<li><b>Nautical twilight</b> uses 12 degrees for the cutoff point,
	at which point it's pretty dark.
	This is 48 minutes after sunset through 48 minutes before sunrise.
<li><b>Astronomical Twilight</b> uses 18 degrees at which point it's as dark as it's going to get.
	This is 1 hour, 12 minutes after sunset through 1 hour, 12 minutes before sunrise.
</ul>
</p>
-->
Many people use <span class="WebUIValue">-6</span> but it's
up to you to determine where the daytime and nighttime transition points should be.
<blockquote>
Startrails, keograms, and timelapse videos are created at the end of nighttime,
so your <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span>
value will determine how dark or light the beginning of the timelapse video is.
</blockquote>
</p>


<h3>Trying different values</h3>
<p>
To see what Allsky uses for today's daytime and nighttime based on your
<span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span>,
<span class="WebUISetting">Latitude</span>, and
<span class="WebUISetting">Longitude</span>, execute:
<pre>allsky-config  show_start_times</pre>
</p>
<p>
You can tell it to use different values by appending one or more of the following
to the command above:
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <code>--angle <b>some_angle</b></code>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <code>--latitude <b>some_latitude</b></code>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <code>--longitude <b>some_longitude</b></code>
</p>

For example:
<pre>
allsky-config  show_start_times  --angle -7.1  --longitude 105W
</pre>
If you want daytime and nighttime to start at a certain time,
execute the command with different angles until you get the times you want.
