<h2>What does the <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> setting do?
How is it related to sunrise and sunset?</h2>
<p>
Your actual sunrise and sunset times are dependent on the day of the year and your
latitude and longitude, and define what most people call <b>daytime</b> and <b>nighttime</b>.
You can tell Allsky when to start using daytime and nighttime settings,
which may be different than actual daytime and nighttime.
</p>
<p>
Allsky defines <b>daytime</b> as your sunrise time <b>plus</b> an offset you define,
called the <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span>
which you set in the <b>Allsky Settings</b> page of the WebUI.
The <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> is a positive or negative number
that indicates the number of degrees
above (positive) or below (negative) the horizon the Sun is when daytime starts.
Daytime ends at sunset <b>minus</b> the <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span>.
The term "daytime ends" is identical to "nighttime begins" since there
is no gap between daytime and nighttime from Allsky's perspective.
</p>
<p>
As an example, assume the Sun rises at 7:00 AM and sets at 18:00 (6:00 PM).
Using an <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> of <span class="WebUIValue">0</span> degrees,
Allsky's daytime starts at 7:00 and nighttime starts at 18:00.
<blockquote>
The Sun moves at 15 degrees per hour, so 6 degrees is 24 minutes
(6 degrees / 15 degrees * 60 minutes).
<br>Remember: daytime ADDs the <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> and nighttime SUBTRACTs it.
</blockquote>
With an <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> of <span class="WebUIValue">6</span> degrees,
Allsky's daytime starts at 7:24 and nighttime at 16:36
(a total of 48 minutes less daytime).
An <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> of <span class="WebUIValue">-6</span> degrees would give 6:36 and 18:24
(48 minutes more daytime).
The <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> effectively determines the length of daytime - the
larger the <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> the shorter the daytime.
</p>

<h4>Why is Angle important?</h4>
<p>
Allsky uses your <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span>
to calculate when to begin using your daytime settings like daytime exposure,
whether or not to take daytime pictures, etc.,
and when to begin using your nighttime settings.
</p>
<p>
Astrophotographers rarely start taking pictures at sunset since it's still too light.
Instead, they start taking pictures when it's much darker, often one of the following times:
<ul>
<li><b>Civil Twilight</b> goes from sunset to when the Sun is 6 degrees below the horizon
	(i.e., <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span> of <span class="WebUIValue">-6</span>),
	and ends when the Sun is coming up and is 6 degrees below the horizon.
	It is still fairly light at Civil Twilight.
<li><b>Nautical twilight</b> uses 12 degrees for the cutoff point,
	at which point it's pretty dark (ignoring light pollution and the Moon).
<li><b>Astronomical Twilight</b> uses 18 degrees at which point it's as dark as it's going to get.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Many people use an <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span>
of <span class="WebUIValue">-6</span> for their allsky camera but it's
up to you to determine where the daytime versus nighttime boundary should be.
<blockquote>
Startrails, keograms, and timelapse videos are created at the end of nighttime,
so your <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span>
value will determine how dark or light the beginning of the timelapse video is.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
To determine Allsky's daytime and nighttime based on your <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span>,
execute:
<pre>
(source ~/allsky/scripts/functions.sh; get_sunrise_sunset)
</pre>
</p>
<p>
It will show you the daytime and nighttime for an
angle of 0 degrees as well as your <span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span>.
You can also specify any angle you want, for example:
<pre>
(source ~/allsky/scripts/functions.sh; get_sunrise_sunset -7.2)
</pre>
