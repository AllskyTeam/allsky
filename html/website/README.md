# Allsky Website ![v2023-05-01](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-2023.05.01-green.svg) 
The "allsky-website" package allows you to display your images on a website, either on your Pi or on another machine. It can optionally add an overlay of constellations and other objects, as well as optional Aurora data.

## Update
This version of the Website **requires** Allsky software version **v2023.05.01** or newer.


## Installation
The installation script for installing on a Pi is documented on the [main Allsky GitHub page](https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky).

Once installed, there are several configuration variables you'll need to change.  Click on the "Documentation" link in the WebUI, then the link for Settings -> Allsky Website.
