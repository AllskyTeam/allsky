## Choosing A lens

Lenses have a few attributes you'll want to be aware of, and together with the camera sensor determine what kind of image you'll see.

Generally, the lower a lens' focal length is (expressed in mm, like 2.1 mm), the wider a field of view (FOV) it produces. Most people like a very wide FOV such as 180 degrees so they can image as much of the sky as possible. Lenses that produce very wide FOVs are usually called fisheye lenses. If your allsky camera is surrounded by lots of trees or buildings and you don't want them in your images, use a higher focal length lens.

Typical focal lengths used in allsky lens are 1.5 mm - 2.5 mm. Some allsky lens can vary their focal length so are called "zoom" lenses. These are more expensive and produce lesser-quality images so are seldom used. Typical FOVs are 120 degrees - 180 degrees.

The aperture of a lens determines how much light it passes through. Lower numbers let more light through but in general produce fuzzier images that you may or may not notice. Typical apertures (prepended by f) used in allsky lens are f 1.4 - f 2.8.

Lenses are round so produce round images. The size of the image it produces on the sensor, measured by its diameter in mm, is called its image circle.

## Image Circles

Most allsky cameras have rectangular sensors that are wider than they are tall. The images below show a sensor (black with dark gray border) and image circles produced by various fictional lenses (white with stars and a yellow borders).

Depending on the physical size of the sensor and the size of the image circle, you'll get different results, as shown below. There is no "right" or "wrong" combination - it's a personal preference.

1. An image circle that is <em>much</em> smaller than the sensor. This uncommon scenario produces a very small sky image.

2. An image circle whose height is the same as the sensor. This shows the whole the sky image and leaves ample room to overlay text and images.
    It's rare to have the sensor height and imager circle be identical as shown below. The AIS 676 is an exception to this and a great camera for Allsky imaging

3. An image circle whose height is bigger than the sensor but whose width is the same as the sensor. This cuts off part of the sky image but minimizes the black border, yet still allows for some space to add text without overwriting the sky image. Most very wide FOV sky images include some landscape and/or buildings around the edges so depending on how much of the sky image is cut off, this combination can be beneficial.

    It's rare to have the sensor width and imager circle be identical as shown below.

4. If the lens' image fills the whole sensor you'll see what appears to be a "normal" image with no black border. This combination is usually the result of a very small camera sensor.
