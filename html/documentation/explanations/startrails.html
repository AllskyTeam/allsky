A <b>startrails</b> is an image that contains all the images from a night on top of each other
in order to show star movement.
<blockquote>
Only nighttime images that are saved are included in a startrails,
so if you don't save your nightime images, they won't be included.
</blockquote>

<h2>Creating a startrails image</h2>
<p>
To have a startrails image <em>automatically</em> created at the end of each night,
enable the
<a allsky="true" external="true" href="/documentation/settings/allsky.html#startrails">
	<span class="WebUISetting">Generate</span></a>
setting in the <span class="subSettingsHeader">Startrails</span> sub-section of the WebUI.
</p>
<p>
To <em>manually</em> create a startrails image run the
<code>generateForDay.sh</code> command.
For example, to create and then upload a startrails to any Allsky Website and/or remote server 
you have for July 10, 2025:
<pre>
generateForDay.sh --startrails 20250710
generateForDay.sh --upload --startrails 20250710
</pre>
This will use the settings specified in the
<span class="subSettingsHeader">Startrails</span> sub-section of the WebUI.
</p>

<h4>Advanced users: running the <code>startrails</code> program</h4>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
<code>generateForDay.sh</code> calls the <code>startrails</code> program
to actually create the startrails, passing it several required arguments
(the <u>underlined</u> ones below),
plus any others you add to the 
<span class="WebUISetting">Startrails Extra Parameters</span> setting.
</p>
<p>
Executing the <code>startrails</code> manually is possible, but not very useful.
If run manually you need to specify at least all the required arguments.
</p>

<pre>
Usage: startrails [-v] -d &lt;dir&gt; -e &lt;ext&gt; [-b &lt;brightness&gt;] [-o &lt;output&gt;] [-S] [-s &lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;]

Arguments:
-h : display this help, then exit
-v : increase log verbosity
-S : print image directory statistics without producing image.
<u>-d &lt;str&gt; : directory from which to read images (required)</u>
<u>-e &lt;str&gt; : filter images to just this extension (required)</u>
<u>-o &lt;str&gt; : output image filename</u>
-s &lt;int&gt;x&lt;int&gt; : restrict processed images to this size
<u>-b &lt;float&gt; : ranges from 0 (black) to 1 (white).</u>
        A moonless sky may be as low as 0.05 while full moon can be as high as 0.4.
</pre>

<br><p>
Example of running the <code>startrails</code> program manually:
<pre>
cd ~/allsky/bin
./startrails -d images/20250710 -e jpg -b 0.15 -o images/20250710/startrails/startrails.jpg
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Startrails settings</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p id="brightnessthreshold">
The only configuration setting for startrails is
<span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>.
Images have an average, or "mean" brightness level from 0.0 (pure black)
to 1.0 (pure white).
The default <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>
is <span class="WebUIValue">0.1</span>
which is a fairly dark image, typical of a moon-less night.
</p>
<p>
Any image with an average brightness <strong>greater than</strong>
the <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>
is skipped during startrails generation,
so <b>daytime images should be skipped</b>.
You need to experiment with this setting to get the best results,
as allsky cameras, lenses, and sky conditions impact an image's average brightness,
and hence what you use for this setting.
Every time a startrails image is created a summary of brightness values is saved to the
Allsky log file.
</p>
<p>
If you aren't seeing trailed star in your images and you get a message like
"<b>No images below threshold 0.100, writing the minimum image only</b>",
your images are too bright and
<span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span> needs to be reduced.
To determine what to number to use
you need to know the typical <b>nighttime</b> sky brightness value.
Do the following:
<ol>
	<li>Run <code>allsky-config &nbsp; get_brightness_info</code>
		to see what your brightness values are.
	<li>If there is no data yet a message will appear with a possible reason,
		otherwise the output will look like:
<pre>
Date                   Minimum    Maximum    Mean       Median
--------------------------------------------------------------
2025-01-17  06:20:45   0.084      0.146      0.103      0.105
2025-01-18  06:16:18   0.045      0.135      0.102      0.106
--------------------------------------------------------------
Total average          0.065      0.140      0.103      0.106
</pre>
		<blockquote>
		Note that the Mean brightness is determined by looking at the <em>whole</em> image,
		including any black areas.
		This number is likely different from the mean brightness that can be overlayed
		onto your images, which is determined by looking at the
		<em>central portion</em> of an image.
		<p>
		If you crop your image, add a mask to it, or change cameras you'll most likely
		need to update the <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span> setting.
		</p>
		</blockquote>
	<li>Set the <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>
		to the <strong>Maximum</strong>, or slightly below it.
		If you have a <code>Total average</code>, use its Maximum.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
You'll now create a startrails and if needed, change
<span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>,
then create another startrails, change the setting, etc.
<ol>
	<li>To make startrails generation MUCH faster,
		do it using a small number of images.
	<li>Create a temporary directory to hold some nighttime images:
		<code>mkdir ~/allsky/images/test</code>.
	<li><code>cd ~/allsky/images/DATE</code>,
		replacing <code>DATE</code> with the date of a non-working startrails.
	<li>Using the timestamp of each image,
		move a few hours of <b>nighttime</b> images to the
		<span class="fileName">~/allsky/images/test</span> directory.
		This is easiest if you first open a "File Manager" window on the Pi -
		you can then select the files with the mouse and
		drag to the <span class="fileName">test</span> directory.
		<br>If you aren't logged into the Pi desktop you'll need to use
		the <code>mv</code> command to move the files.
		Using the <code>*</code> wildcard in the file names will allow you to move
		multiple files at a time.
	<li>Run <code>generateForDay.sh --startrails  test</code>
		to create a startrails file in the <span class="fileName">test</span> directory.
		Look at the image using the <span class="WebUILink">Images</span> page in the WebUI.
	<li>As needed, adjust <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>
		and re-run <code>generateForDay.sh</code>.
	<li>When done, move all the images from the
		<span class="fileName">allsky/images/test</span> directory
		back to <span class="fileName">allsky/images/DATE</span>.
	<li>Remove the temporary directory: <code>rmdir ~/allsky/images/test</code>.
	<li>Now, create the final startrails:
		<ul class="minimalPadding topPadding">
			<li><code>generateForDay.sh --startrails DATE</code>
			<li>If you want to upload the file you just created,
				see the note generated by <code>generateForDay.sh</code>.
		</ul>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p id="troubleshooting">
<blockquote>
It's extremely rare that a startrails image isn't created at all when it's supposed to be.
It's much more common that an image is created but it has no startrails.
When that happens,
see the <a href="#brightnessthreshold">Startrails settings</a> section above.
</blockquote>

If a startrails image isn't being created, first make sure the Startrails
<span class="WebUISetting">Generate</span> setting is enabled.
<br>
If it IS enabled, run:
<pre>generateForDay.sh  --startrails  DATE</pre>
and check for errors.
</p>
<p>
If a startrails image isn't being <em>uploaded</em>, make sure the
Startrails <span class="WebUISetting">Upload</span> setting is enabled.
<br>
If that IS enabled, run:
<pre>generateForDay.sh  --upload  --debug  --startrails  DATE</pre>
and check for errors.
If needed, run <code>testUpload.sh</code> to see why the upload fails.
