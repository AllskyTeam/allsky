<p>
You can add information and buttons to the WebUI's
<span class="WebUIWebPage">System</span> page
without having to change any Allsky files.
The data can be anything you want, but often contains weather, dew heater, and/or fan data.
</p>
This documentation page assumes you are familiar with writing scripts;
if so, adding the information is straightforward
if you follow the instructions on this page.

<p>
The image below shows the types of items that can be added:
<ol class="minimalPadding">
	<li><strong>Simple data</strong>: "<strong>Allsky is the</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;
		<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">BEST!!!</span>"
	<li><strong>Progress bar</strong>: "Dew heater status"
	<li><strong>Buttons</strong>:  "Heater ON" and "Heater OFF".
		Clicking a button performs an action that you define.
</ol>
<img allsky="true" src="systemAdditionsExample.png" class="imgCenter" loading="lazy">
</p>

<h2 id="Details">Details</h2>
<p>
The information to display on the <span class="WebUIWebPage">System</span> page
is described in one or more "data files"
which are listed in the <span class="WebUISetting">System Page Additions</span> setting.
This section describes the format of those data files.
<blockquote>
<b>You</b> need to provide the script(s) to create the data files.
</blockquote>
</p>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Each data file contains one or more lines.
Blank lines and lines that begin with <code>#</code> are ignored.
Each remaining line will display something on the
<span class="WebUIWebPage">System</span> page
and must contain the fields listed in the tables below, separated by <b>tabs</b>.
</p>
<p>
As a very simple example, if you want to add the 2 buttons in the image above
to turn your dew heater on and off you'd have a file called, for example,
<span class="fileName">/home/pi/my_buttons.txt</span>.
That file needs 2 lines describing the attributes for
each button such as color and what it should say (e.g., "Heater ON").
The exact contents of those lines are described below.
The buttons appear on the <span class="WebUILink">System</span> page
when you set the <span class="WebUISetting">System Page Additions</span> setting
to <span class="WebUIValue">/home/pi/my_buttons.txt</span>.
</p>

<p>
There are three types of lines in a data file.
The first word of a line determines what type of line it is:
<ol>
<li><span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">data</span>
	lines specify basic, two-column information that goes before the first progress bar.
	These lines are good when the data has a single value like:
	<br><code>Ambient temperature &nbsp; &nbsp; 20 C</code>
<li><span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">progress</span>
	lines display as progress bars like the CPU Temperature bar in the image above.
	Your bars go after the last system-supplied progress bar and are good when
	the data has an associated status, for example, when the CPU is too hot its bar turns red.
<li><span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">button</span>
	lines add a button to the page under the last system-supplied button,
	and are used to initiate an action like turning a dew heater on.
</ol>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
This section gives an example of adding items to the WebUI's
<span class="WebUILink">System</span> page.
The example assumes you have a weather station that provides
the ambient temperature, humidity, and dew point.
Further, your allsky camera has a dew heater that you want to automatically
turn on and off depending on the weather.
</p>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
You wrote a script called <span class="fileName">/home/pi/weather/getWeatherData.sh</span>
that polls the weather station and writes the ambient temperature, humidity,
and dew point to a data file called <span class="fileName">/home/pi/weather/weatherdata.txt</span>
every minute.
You must manually turn the dew heater on and off via a Python script called
<span class="fileName">/home/pi/dewheater/toggleDewHeater.py</span>.
This command toggles the status of the dew heater and writes the
new status (either "on" or "off") to the data file
<span class="fileName">/home/pi/dewheater/status.txt</span> whenever you call the script.
</p>
<p>
To get this working, consider the following:
</p>

<h4>Determine what data you want to display</h4>
You want to display the temperature, humidity, dew point, and dew heater status.
You will use the humidity and dew point numbers to determine if you should turn the dew heater on or off via a toggle button you'll add to the web page.
You want the ambient temperature in Celsius.
<br><br>
Here's what you'll add to the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">System</span> page:
<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li>temperature
	<li>humidity
	<li>dew point
	<li>dew heater status
	<li>a button to toggle the dew heater on/off
</ul>

<h4>Determine what you want to call the items</h4>
This is pretty easy.
You will set the <b>label</b> fields as follows:
<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li>temperature: <b>Ambient temperature</b>
	<li>humidity: <b>Humidity</b>
	<li>dew point: <b>Dew point</b>
	<li>dew heater status: <b>Dew heater status</b>
	<li>button: <b>Toggle dew heater</b>
</ul>

<h4>Determine how you want the data displayed</h4>
The temperature is just a number with no "good" or "bad" value so it will be of type
<span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">data</span>.
<p>
Although the dew point is also just a number, you want to highlight it when it's
getting close to the ambient temperature so you'll know it's possible for dew to form.
Hence, it will be of type <span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">progress</span>.
</p>
<p>
If the humidity gets too high you want to call attention to it, so it will be of type
<span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">progress</span>.
</p>
<p>
The dew heater toggle switch will be of type
<span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">button</span>.
</p>

<h4>Determine expiration timeout</h4>
If the weather data gets too old it may fool you into turning the dew heater off when it should remain on, so you want its data to expire.
Your weather station provides new data every minute.
If it misses a minute or two you don't want the data on the
<span class="WebUIWebPage">System</span> page to turn red,
so you'll set the temperature and dew point <b>timeout</b> fields to
<code>300</code> seconds (5 minutes).
Just for fun you'll set the humidity <b>timeout</b> value to
<code>600</code> seconds (10 minutes).

<p>
The dew heater status information doesn't change unless you manually turn it on or off,
so you don't want it's status to expire, hence will use <code>0</code> for its <b>timeout</b> value.
</p>

<p>
Timeout values don't apply to buttons.
</p>

<h4>Determine progress bar cutoff values</h4>
You've noticed that when the humidity gets above 90% you get dew on the inside of the dome,
so you'll set the dew heater <b>danger</b> value to <code>85</code>
so it's bar turns red.
You aren't sure what to use for the <b>warning</b>
value so you'll initially set it to <code>75</code>,
and will adjust it later if needed.
By definition humidity ranges from 0% to 100% so use <code>0</code> and <code>100</code> for its
<b>minimum value</b> and <b>maximum value</b> respectively.

<p>
<blockquote class="morePadding">The next paragraph is an advanced topic so feel free to skip it.</blockquote>
The cutoffs for the dew point will vary based on the temperature so require some logic in
<span class="fileName">getWeatherData.sh</span>.
Let's say you decide to set the dew point <b>danger</b> cutoff to be 90% <i>of the ambient temperature</i>,
and the <b>warning</b> cutoff to be 80%.
This means if the ambient temperature is 20 C, the dew point <b>danger</b> cutoff would be
18 C (20 * 0.9) and the <b>warning</b> cutoff would be 16 C (20 * 0.8).
You aren't interested in dew point values significantly less than the ambient temperature since
the chance of dew in those cases is almost zero, so you'll set the dew point <b>minimum value</b>
to the ambient temperature minus 5 degrees.
Likewise, you aren't interested in dew point values significantly greater than the
ambient temperature since it's almost certain there will be dew, so you'll set the <b>maximum value</b>
to the dew point <b>danger</b> value plus 3 degrees.
This in effect sets the left side of the progress bar to be (ambient - 5) and the
right side of the bar to be (<b>danger</b> + 3).
<br>[This may be confusing now, but will clear up when you see what it
looks like and play around with different values.]
</p>

<p>
The other items are of type
<span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">data</span> and
<span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">button</span>
so this step doesn't apply to them.
</p>

<h4>Determine what the buttons should look like</h4>
You like green so will make the dew heater toggle button green by specifying its <b>button color</b> as <code>green</code>.
<p>
You want an icon on the button since the other buttons have icons,
so you go to <a external="true" href="https://fontawesome.com/icons/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>
to look for an icon (Allsky uses Font Awesome version 6).
You pick the "random" icon so set the button's <b>FA icon</b> field to <code>random</code>.
</p>

<h4 id="SystemPageAdditions">Specify the data files</h4>
You need to enter the names of your data files (i.e., the files created by your scripts) in the
<span class="WebUISetting">System Page Additions</span> setting.
But how many data files should you have?
You could put everything in one file but you have two scripts that create data files
and would need to coordinate between them so they don't overwrite each other.
You decide on three data files containing:
<ol class="minimalPadding">
	<li>weather data
	<li>dew heater status
	<li>button information
</ol>
You could have put the button information in the first or second file,
but to simplify the <span class="fileName">toggleDewHeater.py</span>
script you put it in a 3rd file that will never change.
You call the 3rd file <span class="fileName">/home/pi/dewheater/button.txt</span>.
<p class="morePadding">
This is what you enter into the
<span class="WebUISetting">System Page Additions</span> setting.
<pre class="WebUIValue">
/home/pi/weather/weatherdata.txt:/home/pi/dewheater/status.txt:/home/pi/dewheater/button.txt
</pre>
</p>
<blockquote>
The file names must be full path names and must be separated by colons (":").
</blockquote>
<p class="morePadding">
The <span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">data</span>,
<span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">progress</span>, and
<span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">button</span>
lines in the first data file will appear first on the
<span class="WebUIWebPage">System</span> page;
those in the second file will appear second, etc.
You can change the order items appear by changing the order of data file names in the
<span class="WebUISetting">System Page Additions</span> setting.
</p>

<h4>Create/modify scripts to update the data file(s)</h4>
The <span class="fileName">getWeatherData.sh</span>
script needs to write the three weather
<span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">data</span> lines to
<span class="fileName">/home/pi/weather/weatherdata.txt</span>.
It helps if you have the script create header lines in the output
file so you remember what field is what.
The script's logic would be:
<ol class="minimalPadding">
	<li>Get the data from the hardware.
	<li>Optionally write a
		<span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">data</span> header comment to
		<span class="fileName">/home/pi/weather/weatherdata.txt</span>.
		See line 1 below.
	<li>Append the Ambient temperature
		<span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">data</span> line to the file (line 2).
	<li>Optionally append a blank line for readability (line 3).
	<li>Optionally append a
		<span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">progress</span> header comment to the file
		(line 4).
	<li>Calculate new <b>danger</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>minimum value</b>,
		and <b>maximum value</b> numbers for the Dew point based on the ambient temperature
		(line 5).
	<li>Append the Dew point
		<span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">progress</span> line (line 6).
	<li>Append the Humidity
		<span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">progress</span> line (line 7).
	<li>Wait for some period of time, then go back to step 1.
</ol>
<p>
Using the decisions you made above,
the <span class="fileName">/home/pi/weather/weatherdata.txt</span> would look like the following,
assuming the temperature was 20 C, the dew point was 17 C, and the humidity was 87%.
</p>
<blockquote>
The initial line numbers below are only for illustration purposes
and should NOT appear in your file.
</blockquote>
<!-- use 8-character tabs -->
<pre>
1   # Type	Timeout	Label			Data
2   data	300	Ambient temperature	20 C
3   
4   # Type	Timeout	Label			Data	Min	Current	Max	Danger	Warning
5   progress	300	Dew point		17 C	12	17	21	18	16
6   progress	600	Humidity		87%	0	87	100	85	75
</pre>
<p>
Note all fields are separated by one or more <strong>tabs</strong>
(multiple tabs in a row are counted as a single tab).
The header lines (which are ignored since they begin with <code>#</code>) can be in any format,
so to ensure you have the correct fields you lined the header fields up with the data fields below.
</p>

<p class="morePadding">
The <span class="fileName">toggleDewHeater.py</span> script needs to write the
<span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">data</span> line for the dew heater
status to <span class="fileName">/home/pi/dewheater/status.txt</span> every time it is executed.
Its logic is:
<ol class="minimalPadding">
	<li>Get the dew heater status from the hardware.
	<li>Toggle the status.
	<li>Optionally write a
		<span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">data</span>
		header comment line to
		<span class="fileName">/home/pi/dewheater/status.txt</span>.
	<li>Append the new dew heater status
		<span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">data</span>
		line to the file.
	<li>Output "Dew heater turned on" or "Dew heater turned off".
	<li>Exit.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The <span class="fileName">/home/pi/dewheater/status.txt</span>
file will look like the following after clicking the button,
assuming the dew heater is currently off.
</p>
<pre>
# Type	  Timeout  Label                 Data
data	  0        Dew heater status     on
</pre>

<p class="morePadding">
Since the toggle button won't change, create the
<span class="fileName">/home/pi/dewheater/button.txt</span> file manually:
<pre>
# Type    Message  Command                                 Color   FA icon  Button  Label
button    -        /home/pi/dewheater/toggleDewHeater.py   green   random   Toggle  dew heater
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Notice the <b>Message</b> field is <code>-</code> which means there's no message to display on success.
This is because the <span class="fileName">toggleDewHeater.py</span>
command outputs "Dew heater turned on"
or "Dew heater turned off", and that output is displayed as a message.
Remember that if <span class="fileName">toggleDewHeater.py</span> exits with a failure
(i.e., a non-0 exit code)
any error message it outputs will be displayed as an error message on the web page so you
should make sure those error messages are useful.
</p>
<p>
When you press the "Toggle dew heater" button
it will update the <span class="fileName">/home/pi/dewheater/status.txt</span>
data file by changing the "off" to "on" or vice versa.
The rest of the data file remains the same.
</p>

<blockquote>Commands listed in a button's <b>Command</b> field must be executable by the
web server running as group <b>www-data</b>,
and must be in a directory that the web server has permissions to get to.
<br>
<code>chmod g+x /home/pi/dewheater/toggleDewHeater.py</code>
will fix permissions on the Command.
<br><br>
Files written from a button's <b>Command</b> must be writable by <b>www-data</b>.
<br>
<code>chgrp www-data /home/pi/dewheater/status.txt;
chmod g+w /home/pi/dewheater/status.txt</code>
will fix permissions on the file.
</blockquote>

<h4>Test, test, test. Then test some more.</h4>
To get a feel for what things look like and how the above actually works,
copy/paste the above file examples to
<span class="fileName">/home/pi/weather/weatherdata.txt</span>,
<span class="fileName">/home/pi/dewheater/status.txt</span>,
and <span class="fileName">/home/pi/dewheater/button.txt</span> files on your Pi.
Then add
<p>
<pre class="WebUIValue">
/home/pi/weather/weatherdata.txt:/home/pi/dewheater/status.txt
</pre>
to the <span class="WebUISetting">System Page Additions</span> setting.
</p>
Now, go to the <span class="WebUIWebPage">System</span> page in the WebUI
and in addition to the normal information you should see the items you added.
Refreshing the screen won't change those items since the data files are not being updated yet.

<p>
Clicking the "Toggle dew heater" button should display a red message
at the top of the web page that says
<code>'/home/pi/dewheater/toggleDewHeater.py' failed: sh: 1: /home/pi/dewheater/toggleDewHeater.py: not found"</code>
That's the output when the web page tried to execute
<span class='fileName'>/home/pi/dewheater/toggleDewHeater.py</span> which doesn't exist.
</p>

<p>
Try making changes to the three files you created.
For example, change the <b>command</b> for the button to <code>echo 'Hello, world!'</code>.
When you next click on the button you should see a green message at the top saying "Hello, world!".
Now change it to <code>echo 'Hello, world!' ; exit 1</code>.
What happens now?
</p>

After you understand what's happening and why,
start modifying your script(s) to put your own data into the required format.

<h4>Wrong line type</h4>
<img allsky="true" src="systemAdditionsErrorWrongType.png" class="imgCenter" loading="lazy">
If you get this message but the first field IS one of those words,
the fields probably aren't separated by tabs.
In the example above, the <span class="systemPageAdditionsLineType">data</span>
line type is misspelled.


<h4>Incorrect number of fields</h4>
<img allsky="true" src="systemAdditionsErrorNumFields.png" class="imgCenter" loading="lazy">
Look in the tables in the <a href="#Details">Details</a> section to see how many fields
each line type has as as well as what the fields are.
Also make sure ALL fields are separated by tabs.
In the example above, "Dew heater status" is the message, and the "Data" field is missing (e.g., "ON" or "OFF").


<h4>No tabs found</h4>
<img allsky="true" src="systemAdditionsErrorNoTabs.png" class="imgCenter" loading="lazy">
Fields in the lines must be separated by one or more <b>tabs</b>.
Although you can't tell from the message, the field in the file are separated by spaces.


<h4>No permissions</h4>
If your scripts require <code>sudo</code> you'll need to allow the web server to execute the scripts.
To do so:
<ol class="minimalPadding">
	<li>Create a file called, for example, <span class="fileName">myCommands_sudo.txt</span>
		in the same directory as your other files.
	<li>For each script that needs <code>sudo</code> add a line like:
		<pre>www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:<em>full_path_name_to_script</em></pre>
		replacing <em>full_path_name_to_script</em> with the name of the script.
		The web server runs as the <strong>www-data</strong> user;
		these lines allow the web server to use <code>sudo</code> to run your scripts.
	<li>Run:
		<code>sudo &nbsp;cp &nbsp;myCommands_sudo.txt &nbsp;/etc/sudoers.d</code>
	<li>The file should normally be recognized immediately; if not,
		a reboot may be necessary.
</ol>
