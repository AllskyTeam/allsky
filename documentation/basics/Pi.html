<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
This page is for people will little or no Pi experience.
To keep the other Allsky documentation pages a manageable length,
they assume you have basic Pi knowledge.
For example, you know how to turn a Pi on and off and how to connect a camera to it.
</p>

<h3>Operating Systems</h3>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
The Linux operating system controls the Pi's hardware and lets you run software
such as Allsky.
The two most common versions of the Linux operating system are
<b>Buster</b> which was released several years ago, and
<b>Bullseye</b> which was released late 2021.
Allsky runs on both operating systems.
Most people are running the 32-bit version of the operating systems,
although some people have the 64-bit version of Bullseye.
</p>
<p>
There are also different distributions of Linux (called "distros") from various companies.
While they are basically the same Linux,
there can be subtle differences and the administrative commands can vary.
The recommended Linux distro is <b>Debian</b>.
</p>

<h3>Raspberry Pi Models</h3>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
There are several models of the Pi including 1, 2, 3, 4, Zero, and others.
The Pi 3 and 4 are the most common being used for Allsky,
but some people have the Pi Zero because of its low cost.
The various models have different processing power;
the Pi 4 is the most powerful, followed by the 3, then 2, then 1.
The Zero is somewhere around the Pi 3 in terms of processing power.
The Pi 4 is available with up to 8 GB memory whereas the Pi Zero is limited to 0.5 GB memory.
Although Allsky can run on the Zero, several GB of swap space are needed,
and even then, Allsky just barely runs.
The ideal unit is a Pi 4 with 4 GB memory.
Allsky runs nicely on that and the USB 3.0 ports are nice for cameras that support it.
</p>
</details>

<h3>Hardware Overview</h3>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Newer devices come with USB 2 ports and the Pi 4 has a couple USB 3 ports.
They also have a special port to plug the RPi High Definition (HD) camera into.
