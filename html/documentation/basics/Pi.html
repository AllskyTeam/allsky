<p>
This page is for people with little or no Pi experience.
The Allsky documentation assumes you have basic Pi knowledge.
For example, you know how to turn a Pi on and off and how to connect a camera to it.
If not, read this page.
</p>

<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
<p>
The Linux operating system controls the Pi's hardware and lets you run software
such as Allsky.
Just like Windows and MacOS, there are multiple versions of
the Pi's operating system (called "Pi OS"),
and support for old versions is eventually dropped.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bookworm</b> is the current Pi OS
and is what you should run (use the 64-bit version if you can).
Allsky also runs on the older <b>Bullseye</b> operating system.
</p>
<p>
There are different distributions of Linux (called "distros") from various companies.
While they are basically the same Linux,
there can be subtle differences and the administrative commands can vary.
</p>
<blockquote class="warning">
Allsky only supports the <b>Debian</b> distro.
</blockquote>


<h2>Raspberry Pi Models</h2>
<p>
There are several models of the Pi including Zero, Zero 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and others.
These models have different processing power;
the Pi 5 is the most powerful, followed by the 4, then 3, then 2, then 1.
The Zero 2 is near the Pi 3 in terms of processing power but has less memory.
The Pi 4 and 5 are available with up to 8 GB memory whereas the
Pi Zero and Zero 2 are limited to 0.5 GB memory.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../miscellaneous/pickingHardware.html" external="true">This page</a>
will help you pick a Pi that runs well with Allsky.
