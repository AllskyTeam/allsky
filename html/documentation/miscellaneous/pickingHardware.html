<h2>Cameras</h2>
<p>
Your budget will often be the driving factor when picking an allsky camera.
The Raspberry Pi HQ (RPi HQ) camera is relatively inexpensive and produces good images
but can only be used with a Pi.
Many people choose ZWO cameras because they are familiar with them or they
have a spare one lying around, and they may use their allsky camera for astrophotography as well.
</p>
Some things to consider:
<ul>
<li>If you need to buy a camera and will only use it as an allsky camera,
	the RPi HQ camera is hard to beat.
<li>ZWO's ASI120MM (1280x960 resolution) is inexpensive but
	a lot of people complain about its noise and hot pixels.
	The color version is significantly less sensitive.
	We recommend staying away from this camera.
<li>The choice of mono versus color is a personal one.
	Mono cameras are usually more sensitive so require shorter exposures or less gain,
	but many people prefer color for its more "natural" look, especially during the day.
<li>Larger sensors (for example the ASI178MC @ 3096x2080) require more memory
	to produce timelapses, so you may need to follow the suggestions at
	<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/troubleshooting/timelapse.html">this page</a>.
<li>For allsky use, an extremely high resolution usually isn't needed since the lens and
	dome will cause some amount of distortion that will negate the benefits of high resolution.
<li>Newer sensors tend to produce less noise, but not always.
<li>Increasing sensor temperature will always increase noise and hot pixels,
	sometimes to the point of making the image unusable.
<li>Different cameras have different dynamic ranges
	(the difference between the brightest and darkest parts).
	Increasing a camera's gain will produce brighter, noisier images with less dynamic range.
	Consult the camera specs to learn more about the trade-off between gain and dynamic range,
	eg. <a href="https://astronomy-imaging-camera.com/product/asi482mc">ASI482MC</a>,
	<a href="https://astronomy-imaging-camera.com/product/asi290mm">ASI290MM</a>
	<a href="https://astronomy-imaging-camera.com/product/asi120mc">ASI120MC</a>,
	<a href="https://astronomy-imaging-camera.com/product/asi178mc">ASI178MC</a>.
<li>ZWO cameras usually have a 60 second auto-exposure limit.
	That may not matter much in practice since shots longer than that will usually
	produce noticeable star trailing.
<li>The "T7C" camera is an OEM version of the ASI120MC-mini.
	We <a allsky="true" href="/documentation/troubleshooting/T7cameras.html">do not recommend</a>
	it.
</ul>


<h2>Lenses</h2>
<p>
Although picking a camera is fairly easy since Allsky only supports ZWO and Rpi cameras,
picking a lens is more difficult.
The lens and camera sensor together determine what kind of image you'll see:
<ul>
	<li>a round image
	<li>a round image with the top and bottom cut off
	<li>a full rectangle image
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The lower the focal length of the lens the wider of a field of view (FOV) it produces.
Most people like a wide or very wide FOV for an allsky camera, for example, 180 degrees,
so they can image as much of the sky as possible.
Lenses that produce very wide FOV are called <strong>fisheye</strong> lenses.
</p>
<p>
Lenses are round so produce round images.
<blockquote>
If you want to see this for yourself,
in a bright area take your lens and hold it a little above a flat surface.
Move the lens up and down to produce an in-focus image.
What shape is the image?
How large is the image?
</blockquote>
Most cameras have rectangular sensors that are wider than taller.
<ol>
	<li>If the image created by the lens fits completely on the camera's sensor you'll see
		a round image with black outside of it.
	<li>If most, but not all of the lens' image fits on the sensor you'll see a round image
		with the top and bottom cut off.
	<li>If the lens' image fills the whole sensor you'll see what appears to be
		a "normal" image with no black.
	</ul>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
To determine which of the three above you'll get you need to know the physical size of the
camera's sensor and the size of the image circle produced by the lens.
The sensor size is easy to get - almost all web pages that mention the sensor
list its size.
Not all lens web pages list the image circle size though - in fact,
one of the lenses below didn't list the image size.
</p>
<p>
DISCLAIMER: this list is not meant to recommend anything;
it's only for your information to illustrate a point.

<p>
The tables below list some common allsky cameras and some lenses.
Below the tables is an example of the results that different lenses on the same camera produce.

<p>
As an example, let's use the common ZWO ASI178 camera with a couple different lenses.
<ol>
	<li>Lens ACF12F0155IRMM: 1.5 mm focal length.
		<br>
		The image circle of the lens (4.6 mm) is <strong>smaller</strong> than the height of the sensor (5.0 mm),
		so you'll see the full circle image produced by the lens with a little bit of black above and below,
		and a fair amount of black on the sides.
		You may want to crop the sides of the image to remove some of the black
		and save disk space.
	<li>Lens ACTCS25IR8MPF: 2.5 mm focal length.
		<br>
		The image circle of the lens (6.4 mm) is <strong>larger</strong> than the height of the sensor (5.0 mm)
		but smaller than the width of the sensor (7.4 mm),
		so you'll see a circle with the top and bottom cut off a fair amount,
		and some amount of black on the sides.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
As you can see, with the same camera you get quite different results depending on the lens used.
In the examples above, if you used a camera with a much larger sensor you would see the full
cicular image even with the 2.5 mm lens.
On the other hand, if you used a much <strong>smaller</strong> sensor, like the ASI224,
you would see a slightly cut-off circle with the 1.5 mm lens
and would see a rectangular image with no black using the 2.5 mm lens.
</p>
<p>
Also notice that the camera's <strong>resolution</strong> did not come into play.
It only determines how much <em>detail</em> you can see,
not how much of the image you can see.
</p>
<p>
If you have a lot of trees or buildings blocking the horizon and you want to
minimize how much of them you see,
get a lens with a higher focal length and hence a narrower FOV.
