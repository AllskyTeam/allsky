<h2>Images flicker or strobe in brightness</h2>

<h3>During Daytime AND Nighttime</h3>
<p>
If images in the WebUI's Liveview mode or the Allsky Website flicker every
time a new image appears, it is probably because you are using the Firefox browser.
It has a known issue with image updates.
Please try a different browser.
To ensure the issue is browser-related,
look at the images saved in <span class="fileName">~/allsky/images/DATE</span>
to see if they flicker.
</p>

<h3>Daytime only flicker - ZWO cameras</h3>
<p>
Daytime auto exposures with ZWO cameras use an AllSky algorithm that looks
at part of the image (called the <b>histogram box</b>) to determine the average brightness,
and adjusts exposure to keep the brightness within an acceptable range.
By default the histogram box is centered on the image.
If the Sun or Moon go through that box, your images may flicker, especially if it is cloudy.
If that's the case, try moving the histogram box to one of the corners
(but be sure it's within the image the camera lens produces and NOT in the black border).
You can also try adjusting the histogram box size - it should be around 15% of the
width of the camera sensor in pixels.
For a sensor that's 1000 pixels wide, a histogram box of 150 pixels wide is a good place to start.
</p>
<p>
If you are STILL having flicker issues after doing the above,
please do the following so we can debug:
<pre>
sudo systemctl stop allsky
sudo truncate -s 0 /var/log/allsky.log
</pre>
In the WebUI change the <span class="WebUISetting">Debug Level</span> to
<span class="WebUIValue">4</span> then click on
<img allsky="true" class="buttonIcon" src="/documentation/img/saveChangesButton.png">.
Let it run for a couple minutes so it includes the flickering,
then upload <span class="fileName">/var/log/allsky.log</span>.
</p>

<h3>Nighttime only flicker - ZWO</h3>
<p>
Nighttime images use the ZWO algorithm, not the Allsky algorithm for auto exposure.
If you see flickering at night, try the following - these steps have helped some people,
but not everyone:
<ul>
<li>Toggle the <span class="WebUISetting">Version 0.8 Exposure</span> setting in the WebUI.
<li>Change the <span class="WebUISetting">USB Bandwidth</span> and
	<span class="WebUISetting">Auto USB</span> settings in the WebUI.
<li>Add a more powerful power supply to the Pi,
	or a thicker/shorter wire from the power supply to the Pi.
	The Pi may not be getting enough power,
	which causes it to not provide enough power to the camera.
<li>Add a powered USB 3 hub between the Pi and the camera
	to ensure the camera's getting enough power.
<li>Update the Pi's firmware by executing <code>sudo rpi-update</code>.
</ul>

<blockquote>
We are still investigating nighttime flickering, since it only happens for some cameras,
and didn't happen with Allsky version 0.7.
