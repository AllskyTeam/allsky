<h2>After starting Allsky, all I get is "Allsky software is starting up"</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Most likely Allsky is dropping all images for being overly dark or overly bright due to inappropriate settings.
Check the log to see what it says by running
<code>tail -f /var/log/allsky.log</code> in a terminal window.
</p>
<p>
If you are using <b>manual</b> exposure/gain try adjusting those values.
</p>
<p>
If you are using <b>auto</b> exposure/gain, the starting values are what you specified as the manual values,
and it may take several exposures for the software to find the best exposure.
While it's doing that, you'll see the "Allsky software is starting up" message.  This is normal.
However, if the message remains after several minutes follow the instructions
<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/troublehsooting/reportingProblems.html">here</a>
to report the problem.
</p>
<p>
You can also temporarily set the
<span class="WebUISetting">Remove Bad Images Thresholds</span> to
<span class="WebUIValue">0</span>
to see what the incorrectly exposed images look like - this
might give you an idea of the problem.
</p>
</details>


<h2>Why is there is a long delay between pictures?</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
The time between when one picture ends and another starts is determined by
these settings:
<ol>
	<li><span class="WebUISetting">Delay</span> (daytime or nighttime).
	<li><span class="WebUISetting">Max Auto-Exposure</span> (daytime or nighttime),
		even if you are using manual exposure.
	<li><span class="WebUISetting">Consistent Delays Between Images</span>.
</ol>
There are two possibilities:
<ol>
	<li>If <span class="WebUISetting">Consistent Delays Between Images</span> is "Yes",
		then the total delay is <strong>always</strong>:
		<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		<span class="WebUISetting">Delay</span> +
		<span class="WebUISetting">Max Auto-Exposure</span>.
	<li>If <span class="WebUISetting">Consistent Delays Between Images</span> is "No",
		then the total delay is simply the <span class="WebUISetting">Delay</span>.
</ol>
If the time between pictures is longer than you expected,
check your <span class="WebUISetting">Max Auto-Exposure</span>.
</p>
</details>


<h2 id="SDwear">How do I reduce wear on my SD card?</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
SD cards have a limited number of writes they can handle before they wear out.
Although this is usually a very large number you may want to
minimize writes to the SD card
by moving the <span class="fileName">~/allsky/tmp</span>
directory from the SD card into memory.
</p>
<p>
During Allsky installation you were prompted to do this -
if you did you can ignore this FAQ item.
</p>

<blockquote>
If you have a Pi 5 or newer you can also replace the SD card with an NVMe SSD disk
which is much faster, more reliable, and allows significantly more space than an SD card
(but costs more).
To do this you'll need to add a board to your Pi
(called an <strong>NVMe HAT</strong>) as well as an NVMe disk.
Search for those terms on the Internet to see your options.
</blockquote>

Before putting <span class="fileName">~/allsky/tmp</span> into memory
note the following:
<ul>
<li>In order to do this you'll need enough free RAM memory,
	so this may not work well with systems with very limited memory, for example, 512 MB.
<li>The <span class="fileName">~/allsky/tmp</span> directory and its contents
	will be erased every time you reboot your Pi.
	This is ok since that directory is only used for temporary files (hence the same)
	that are invalid after a reboot.
</ul>
<p>
then execute:
<pre>
allsky-config  recheck_tmp
</pre>

You should accept the defaults.
</details>


<h2>How do I focus my allsky camera?</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<h3>Manual-focus cameras</h3>
<p>
Almost all lenses have a focus ring that you turn to change the focus.
If you lens does NOT have a focus ring or some other focusing mechanism,
you can skip this page.
<p>
Try to get your camera at least roughly focused during the day.
It'll be easier to see the focus ring on your lens,
and exposure duration will be much shorter so you'll get more instant feedback.
Focusing on slow-moving clouds works well.
</p>
<p>
Make the following temporary changes in the WebUI:
<ul class="minimalPadding topPadding">
	<li>Turn off the <span class="WebUISetting">Save</span>
		setting for the part of the day you are focusing (daytime or nighttime).
	<li>Set the corresonding <span class="WebUISetting">Delay</span> to
		<span class="WebUIValue">500</span> ms (1/2 second).
	<li>If focusing during the day, also set the <span class="WebUISetting">Max Auto-Exposure</span>
		to <span class="WebUIValue">500</span> ms.
		<br>
		These changes will give a short time between images and the WebUI's
		<span class="WebUILink">Live View</span> will automatically refresh the screen every second.
	<li>If you are using the <span class="WebUIValue">module</span>
		<span class="WebUISetting">Overlay Method</span>,
		enable the <span class="WebUISetting">Show Focus Metric</span>,
		and in the <span class="WebUILink">Overlay Editor</span> page add the <strong>${FOCUS}</strong>
		variable to the image anywhere you want.
		Use a large font to make it easier to see.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Most lenses have a screw to lock the focus ring - if your's does, loosen the screw.
A focus number will appear on the images - the higher the number, the better focus.
The number can change depending on the brightness, so focus when the brightness isn't changing.
Look at the image and the focus number then turn the lens' focus ring.
If the image and focus number get worse, turn the ring the other way.
At some point the image will get worse - that means you've past the best focus,
so turn the focus ring in very small increments the other direction.
<p>
This method is often "good enough" but the most accurate (and slowest) way to focus is at night using stars.
Zoom in on the image and look for stars that are bright but not saturated.
Keep focusing until the stars are as small as possible.
</p>
<p>
When done focusing tighten the focus lock screw (be careful not to move the focus ring)
and revert all settings back to their original values.
</p>

<h3>Auto-focus cameras</h3>
<p>
If you have a camera with an auto-focus lens like the RPi Module 3, see the
<a external="true" href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/camera_software.html#autofocus-mode">camera documentation</a>
for a description of focus-related settings.
You'll use the <span class="WebUIValue">--lens-position</span> setting
to determine where the best focus is.
Run the following (which puts the lens at infinity),
then as needed, increase the lens position in small increments until you
find the best focus:
<pre>
libcamera-still --timeout 1 -shutter 5000 --lens-position 0.0
</pre>
You will likely need to adjust the shutter speed to get a good exposure.
</p>
<p>
Once the camera is focused we suggest <strong>disabling</strong> auto focus
since it adds several seconds to each daytime image while it's finding focus,
and adds minutes to nighttime images.
To do so, add <span class="WebUIValue">--lens-position X</span>
to the <span class="WebUISetting">Extra Parameters</span> setting in the WebUI,
replacing <span class="WebUISetting">X</span> with the lens position of best focus.

<h2>How do I change the icons on the Allsky Website?</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
The icons on the left side of an Allsky Website page and what happens when you click one are controlled by the
<a external="true" href="../settings/allskyWebsite.html#leftSidebar">
	<span class="editorSetting">leftSidebar</span> setting</a>.
The icon itself is specified via the <span class="editorSetting">icon</span> sub-setting.
See the <a external="true" href="https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free&o=r">Font Awesome</a> page
(version 6.2.1) for other choices.
Note that not all icons work so you'll need to try them.
</p>
</details>


<h2>The <span class="fileName">/var/log/allsky.log</span> file is gone.  How do I get it back?</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Do the following in order, stopping when the log file reappears:
<ol>
	<li>Try restarting the software: <code>sudo systemctl restart allsky</code>.
	<li>Restart the software that controls the log files:
		<code>sudo systemctl restart syslog</code>.
	<li>Reboot the Pi.
	<li>Wait until tomorrow - sometimes the log file
		mysteriously reappears after midnight.
		Note this is NOT an Allsky problem since it also happens with other services.
</ol>
