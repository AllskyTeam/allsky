# Upload settings

	# PROTOCOL determines how the files will be uploaded and is one of:
	#  "local"	copies to a location on your Pi.
	#  "ftp"	uploads to an FTP server.
	#		See the "ftp / sftp PROTOCOL only" section below.
	#  "sftp"	(secure ftp) - uploads to an FTP server that supports secure transfer.
	# 		Use "sftp" instead of "ftp" if you can - it's more secure.
	#		See the "ftp / sftp PROTOCOL only" section below.
	#  "scp"	(secure copy) - copies to a remote server.
	#		See the "scp PROTOCOL only" section below.
	#  "S3"		uploads to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) server.
	#		See the "S3 PROTOCOL only" section below.

# YOU must create directories on the remote server (or on your Pi if PROTOCOL="local")
# for the variables below that end in "_DIR" (for example, IMAGE_DIR).
# X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*X*XX*X*X*X*X*X*X


# By default, the destination file name is the same as the file being uploaded.
# The *_DESTINATION_NAME variables below can be set to specify a DIFFERENT destination name.
# For example, if the file being uploaded is "allsky-20210710.mp4" you may want it
# called "allsky.mp4" on the remote web server so the name is always the same.
# In that case, set   VIDEOS_DESTINATION_NAME="allsky.mp4"
# If you want the destination file name to be the same as what's being uploaded,
# leave the *_DESTINATION_NAME blank.

# The WEB_*_DIR variables below are optionally used to copy a file to a directory on the Pi
# IN ADDITION TO being uploaded to a remote server.
# This is useful, for example, if your Pi's webpage cannot be reached from the Internet and
# you want an image to exist on the Pi AND on a remote web server.
# In that case, upload to the remote server using the PROTOCOL variable,
# and set the corresponding WEB_*_DIR variables to directories on your Pi.
# For example, for a timelapse, set VIDEOS_DIR to the name of the directory on the
# remote web server, and set WEB_VIDEOS_DIR to the name of the directory on your Pi,
# which will usually be in /var/www/html/allsky/videos.

	# The remote directory where the current "image.jpg" file should go.
IMAGE_DIR=""

	# The remote directory where the timelapse video should go.
	# Some people prefer to put timelapse, keogram, and startrails in separate directories.
VIDEOS_DIR=""
VIDEOS_DESTINATION_NAME=""
WEB_VIDEOS_DIR=""

	# The remote directory where the keogram image should go.
KEOGRAM_DIR=""
KEOGRAM_DESTINATION_NAME=""
WEB_KEOGRAM_DIR=""

	# The remote directory where the startrails image should go.
STARTRAILS_DIR=""
STARTRAILS_DESTINATION_NAME=""
WEB_STARTRAILS_DIR=""

# These are for for backwards compatibility and will be removed in the future. DO NOT CHANGE!

MP4DIR="${VIDEOS_DIR}"


############### ftp / sftp PROTOCOL only:
	# Enter the name of your FTP server.  If you don't know it, ask your service provider.
HOST=""

	# Enter the username of the login on your FTP server
USER=""

	# Enter the password of the login on your FTP server
PASSWORD=""

	# If you need special commands executed when connecting to the FTP server enter them here.
	# For example, to allow lftp to work with unknown certificates, use:
	#	LFTP_COMMANDS="set ssl:check-hostname false"
	# If you have more than one command to enter, separate them with semicolons (;).
LFTP_COMMANDS=""


############### scp PROTOCOL only:	!!!! NOT IMPLEMENTED YET - FOR FUTURE USE !!!!
	# Enter the name of the remote server.
SCP_SERVER=""

	# Enter the username of the login on your remote server.
SCP_USER=""


############### S3 PROTOCOL only:
	# You will need to install the AWS CLI:
	#   sudo apt-get install python3-pip
	#   pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user
	#   export PATH=/home/pi/.local/bin:$PATH
	#   aws configure
	# When prompted, enter a valid access key ID, Secret Access Key, and Default region name,
	# for example, (e.g. "us-west-2").  Set the Default output format to "json" when prompted.

	# AWS CLI directory where the AWS CLI tools are installed.
	# If you used a different PATH variable above, change AWS_CLI_DIR to match it.
AWS_CLI_DIR="/home/pi/.local/bin"

	# Name of S3 Bucket where the files will be uploaded (must be in Default region specified above).
	# You may want to turn off or limit bucket versioning to avoid consuming lots of
	# space with multiple versions of the "image.jpg" files.
S3_BUCKET="allskybucket"

	# S3_ACL is set to private by default.
	# If you want to serve your uploaded files vis http(s), change S3_ACL to "public-read".  
	# You will need to ensure the S3 bucket policy is configured to allow public access to
	# objects with a public-read ACL.
	# You may need to set a CORS policy in S3 if the files are to be accessed by
	# Javascript from a different domain.
