				</ul>

				<hr class="separator"><!-- =========================================== -->
			</details>


			<h2>v2023.05.01_02 - Point Release # 2</h2>
			<details>
				<summary></summary>
				<h4>Enhancements</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The <span class="WebUISetting">Mean Threshold</span> setting now has
						separate daytime and nighttime settings.
					</li>
					<li>The installation keeps track of where it is so if you have to exit it,
						for example, to update the locale, it resumes where it left off.
					</li>
					<li>The installation skips steps that aren't needed.
						This greatly decreases the time when upgrading from v2023.05.01 or v2023.05.01_01.
						It can also skip the reboot if possible.
					</li>
					<li id="sensorTemperature">(RPi on Bullseye only) You can display the sensor temperature by
						doing the following:
						<ul>
							<li>Add <span class="WebUIValue">--metadata &nbsp; /home/pi/allsky/config/overlay/extra/libcamera.json</span>
								to the <span class="WebUISetting">Extra Arguments</span> setting in the WebUI.</li>
							<li>In the <span class="WebUIWebPage">Overlay Editor's</span>
								<span class="ManagerName">Variable Manager</span>,
								look for <span class="variableManagerVariableName">AS_SensorTemperature</span> in the
								<span class="variableManagerTab">All Variables</span> tab.
								Click on <span class="btn btn-primary btn-small">+</span>
								and define the variable:
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Format</strong>: <code>{:n}</code> &nbsp; (a whole number)</li>
									<li><strong>Type</strong>: <code>Number</code></li>
									<li>Enter whatever you'd like in the other fields.</li>
									<li>Click on <span class="btn btn-primary btn-small">Save changes</span>.
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>In the <span class="variableManagerTab">Allsky Variables</span> tab
								look for <span class="variableManagerVariableName">${SensorTemperature}</span>
								in the <strong>Variable Name</strong> column and
								click on the <span class="btn btn-primary btn-small">+</span> button.
								Move and format the field as desired.
							</li>
							<li>Click on the flashing <i class="fa-solid fa-floppy-disk green"></i> icon.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Setting the <span class="WebUISetting">Mean Target</span> for daytime and nighttime
						didn't work - the default values were used instead.
					</li>
					<li>Keograms, startrails, and timelapse weren't being create at the end of night.</li>
				</ul>

				<hr class="separator"><!-- =========================================== -->
			</details>

			<h2>v2023.05.01_01 - Point Release # 1</h2>
			<details>
				<summary></summary>
				<h4>Enhancements</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>If multiple consecutive "bad" images are found,
						a warning image is now displayed saying how many "bad" images were found.
						A system warning in the WebUI is also displayed with instructions on what to check.
						<br>
						When Allsky starts it displays an "Allsky is Starting" image until the first
						good image is saved.
						Depending on your settings and the sky brightness,
						it may take many images before it gets a good one to save.
						The new warning image makes it obvious Allsky hasn't hung.
					</li>
					<li>In the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> page,
						the buttons (e.g., "Save changes") are now at the top of the page
						and stay there as you scroll down.
						A new "Top" button appears at the bottom of the page after you scroll
						to make it quick to get back to the top.
					</li>
					<li>Selecting <code>Refresh</code> from the
						<span class="WebUISetting">Camera Type</span> drop-down
						can be used to change cameras of the same
						<span class="WebUISetting">Camera Type</span>.
						For example, replacing a ZWO ASI120 with an ASI290.
					</li>
					<li>Greatly sped up the installation process when packages are not
						already installed by using prebuilt binaries where possible.
					</li>
					<li>Changing to a camera that Allsky hasn't seen before will use the
						prior camera's settings that typically are the same for all cameras,
						for example,
						<span class="WebUISetting">Latitude</span>,
						<span class="WebUISetting">Angle</span>,
						and
						<span class="WebUISetting">Owner</span>.
						You'll still need to verify other settings like exposure times
						are appropriate for the new camera.
						<br>
						Changing to a camera that Allsky HAS seen before will
						use all that camera's prior settings.
					</li>
					<li>The installation only prompts for a new hostname if the current one
						is still the default "raspberrypi".
						The suggested new name is still "allsky".
						If the current hostname is anything other than the default the user
						already changed the Pi's name, so don't prompt to change again.
					</li>
					<li>Check at startup if the settings file is properly linked to a
						camera-specific file.
						When it isn't, changes to the settings won't be propogated during
						updates to Allsky or when switching cameras.
					</li>
					<li>ZWO only:
						<ul>
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">ZWO Experimental Exposure</span>
							is a new setting that will use the Allsky auto-exposure algorithm
							at night (assuming nighttime auto-exposure is enabled).
							Initial testing indicates this improves the exposure of nightime images.
							<blockquote>
							If you enable this setting, please let us know if it helps or not
							by entering a Discussion item in GitHub.
							<strong>We need the feedback.</strong>
							</blockquote>
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Target Mean</span> can now be specified
							for daytime and nighttime.
							This is the same as for RPi cameras - values range from
							<code>0.0</code> (pure black) to <code>1.0</code> (pure white).
							<code>1.0</code> is equivalent to <code>255</code> in the ${MEAN}
							variable in the <span class="editorName">Overlay Editor</span>.
							</li>
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Mean Threshold</span> can now be specified.
							This is the same as for RPi cameras and determines how close the
							mean brightness needs to be to the 
							<span class="WebUISetting">Target Mean</span>.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>If there are multiple Wi-Fi interfaces, information on each one will be displayed.
					</li>
					<li>The WebUI now validates numbers.
						For example, entering <span class="WebUIValue">X300</span>
						for an exposure will produce an error.
						Hovering your mouse over a number's value will tell you if it
						must be a whole number or it accepts fractions.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="shSetting">REMOVE_BAD_IMAGES</span> would often flag dark,
						but "good" images as "bad" and not save them using the default
						<span class="shSetting">REMOVE_BAD_IMAGES_THRESHOLD_LOW</span>
						value of <code>1</code> (which is still a good default).
						<blockquote>
							If after installing this point release you are still getting a lot of "bad" images,
							do NOT disable <span class="shSetting">REMOVE_BAD_IMAGES</span> - instead,
							modify the <span class="shSetting">REMOVE_BAD_IMAGES_THRESHOLD_*</span> values as needed.
					</li>
					</blockquote>
					<li>The <code>s3</code> upload protocol now sets the destination file name to
						<span class="fileName">image.jpg</span> instead of
						<span class="fileName">image-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.jpg</span>.
					</li>
					<li>The <code>scp</code> upload protocol now uses the
						<span class="shSetting">REMOTE_USER</span> setting.
					</li>
					<li>Set the upper limits on the x and y spinner controls in the overlay property editors to the size
						of the image, previously these were hard coded to 2048.</li>
					<li>When adding a new variable to the overlay variable list it can now be selected without
						refreshing the page.</li>
					<li>When an image is moved out of bounds using the x and y spinner controls a red rectangle will be
						drawn around the image, the same as if it were dragged out of bounds.</li>
					<li>Fixed a bug when compiling on i386 platforms, due to a recent Pi OS change.</li>

			<h2>v2023.05.01 - Current Major Release</h2>
			<details>
				<summary></summary>

				<h4>Core Allsky</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>New camera support:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li>All ZWO cameras as of May 1, 2023.
							<li>RPi HQ and Module 3 cameras.
							<li>ArduCam 16 and 64 MP cameras.
							<li>The RPi "Global Shutter Camera" is NOT supported - high speed shutters aren't useful for
								allsky images.
						</ul>
					<li>"Mini" timelapse videos can be created that contain a user-configurable
						number of the most recent images.
						This allows you to continually see the recent sky conditions.
					<li>Installation improvements:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li>If there is not enough swap space configured you are prompted to add more.
								Doing this decreases the chance of timelapse creation problems.
							<li>If <span class="fileName">allsky/tmp</span> is not a memory-resident
								filesystem you are prompted to make it one.
								This SIGNIFICANTLY decreases the number of writes to the SD card, prolonging its life.
							<li>If a <span class="fileName">~/allsky-OLD</span> directory is found it's
								assumed to be a prior release of Allsky and you are prompted to have its images,
								darks, and other items moved to the new release.
								See the <a allsky="true" external="true" href="installation/Allsky.html">Installing /
									Upgrading -&gt; Allsky</a>
								page for instructions for installing this release.
						</ul>
					<li><code>scripts/check_allsky.sh</code> was added to perform basic sanity
						checking of your Allsky installation.
						Run it after you're done configuring Allsky to see if you have any issues.
					<li><span class="WebUISetting">latitude</span> and <span class="WebUISetting">longitude</span>
						can now be specified as either a decimal number
						(e.g., <code>-105.21</code>) or with N, S, E, W (e.g., <code>105.21W</code>).
					<li>Removed several settings from <span class="fileName">config.sh</span>:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li><span class="shSetting">CAMERA</span>: To update the camera type, use the new
								<span class="WebUISetting">Camera Type</span> setting in the WebUI.
								This is an advanced setting so you need to click the "Show Advanced Options" button to
								view it.
							<li><span class="shSetting">POST_END_OF_NIGHT_DATA</span> is no longer needed since
								Allsky automatically determines if you have a local Allsky Website, a remote one, or
								both.
						</ul>
					<li>New ftp-settings.sh variables:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li><span class="shSetting">REMOTE_PORT</span> specifies a non-default FTP port.
							<li><span class="shSetting">SSH_KEY_FILE</span> is the path to an SSH private key.
								When <span class="editorString">scp</span> is used for uploads,
								this identify file will be used to establish the secure connection.
							<li>The Secure CP (<span class="editorString">scp</span>) and Google Cloud Service
								(<span class="editorString">gcs</span>) protocols are now supported for file uploads.
						</ul>
					<li>The Wiki now points to files in the GitHub <span class="fileNamw">documentation</span>
						directory.
						A copy of that directory is also on the Pi and accessible via the Documentation link in the
						WebUI.
					<li>The Allsky Documentation has been <strong>significantly</strong> enhanced and expanded.
						Its goal is to be a single source for everything you need to know about Allsky.
						If you don't know how to do something, look it up.
						If it's not in the documentation, let us know.
					<li><span class="shSetting">AUTO_STRETCH</span> now works, and is documented with sample images.
					<li>Images can now be uploaded using the full <span class="fileNamw">image-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.jpg</span>
						name instead of the shorter <span class="fileName">image.jpg</span> name.
						See the <span class="shSetting">IMG_UPLOAD_ORIGINAL_NAME</span> Allsky setting in the
						documentation.
					<li>Many minor enhancements and bug fixes were made.
				</ul>


				<h4>WebUI</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The WebUI is now installed as part of the Allsky installation and <strong>must</strong> be
						used to make all settings changes.
						<blockquote>
							The <a external="true"
								href="https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky-portal">allsky-portal</a>
							repository will be removed as it is no longer needed.
						</blockquote>
					<li>New links on the left side of the WebUI:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li><span class="WebUILink">Overlay Editor</span> allows you to drag and drop the text
								and images you want overlayed on the images.
								This is a <strong>significant</strong> improvement over the old mechanism and lets you
								vary the font size, color, rotation, etc. for everything you add.
								You can use variables in the text which get replaced at run-time, e.g., the time the
								image was taken.
							<li><span class="WebUILink">Module Manager</span> allows you to specify what actions should
								take place after an image has been saved.
								For example you can add an overlay or count the number of stars or periodically control
								a dew heater.
								Users can develop (and hopefully share) their own modules.
								Full notes on how to <a allsky="true" external="true"
									href="modules/modules.html">develop modules</a>
								is included in the documentation.
							<li>The <span class=">WebUILink">Allsky Documentation</span>
								link accesses the documentation on your Pi.
						</ul>
					<li>Minimum, maximum, and default values are now correct for all camera models.
					<li>Required fields with missing data are shown in red with a message saying the data is missing.
						For example, <span class="WebUISetting">Latitude</span> is a required field.
					<li>New settings on the <span class="WebUILink">Allsky Settings</span> page:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Camera Type</span> is either ZWO or RPi.
								This replaces the <span class="shSetting">CAMERA</span> variable in the
								<span class="fileName">config.sh</span>
								file and also allows you to switch between cameras connected to the Pi.
								For example, if you have both an RPi and ZWO camera attached, you can switch between
								them using this setting.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Max Auto-Exposure</span> for day and night.
								When using auto-exposure, exposure times will not exceed this value.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Max Auto-Gain</span> for day and night.
								When using auto-gain, gain values will not exceed this value.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Auto White Balance</span>, <span class="WebUISetting">Red
									Balance</span>,
								and <span class="WebUISetting">Blue Balance</span> are now available for day and night.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Frames to Skip</span> for day and night determine how many
								initial
								auto-exposure frames to ignore when starting Allsky, while the auto-exposure
								algorithm homes in on the correct exposure.
								These frames are often over or under exposed so not worth saving anyhow.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Consistent Delays</span> determines whether or not the time
								between the start of
								exposures will be consistent (current behavior) or not.
								When enabled, the time between images is the maximum exposure time plus the delay you
								set.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Overlay Method</span> determines if the text overlay
								(exposure, time, etc.)
								should be done by the legacy program or by the new "module" system (see above).
								<blockquote>The default method will change to the module method in the next release of
									Allsky,
									and after that the legacy overlay method will be removed.
								</blockquote>
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Require WebUI Login</span> specifies whether
								or not the WebUI should require you to login.
								Only set this to <span class="WebUIValue">No</span>
								if your Pi is on a local network and you trust everyone on the network.
								<strong>Do NOT disable it if your Pi is accessible via the Internet!</strong>
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Cooling</span> and <span class="WebUISetting">Target
									Temp.</span>
								(ZWO only) now have separate settings for day and night.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Aggression</span> (ZWO only)
								determines how much of a calculated exposure change should be applied.
								This helps smooth out brightness changes, for example, when a car's headlights appear in
								one frame.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Gamma</span> (ZWO only) changes the contrast of an image.
								It is only supported by a few cameras; for those that don't,
								the <span class="shSetting">AUTO_STRETCH</span> setting can produce a similar effect.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Offset</span> (ZWO only)
								adds about 1/10th the specified amount to each pixel's brightness,
								thereby brightening the whole image.
								etting this too high causes the image to turn gray.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Contrast</span> and
								<span class="WebUISetting">Sharpness</span>(RPi only).
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Extra Parameters</span> (RPi only) replaces the
								<span class="shSetting">CAPTURE_EXTRA_PARAMETERS</span>
								variable in the <span class="fileName">config.sh</span> file,
								and allows you to pass parameters to the <code>libcamera-still</code>
								image capture program that Allsky doesn't natively support, such as auto-focus options.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Mean Target</span> (RPi only) for day and night.
								This specifies the mean target brightness (0.0 (pure black) to
								1.0 (pure white)) when in auto-exposure mode.
							<li><span class="WebUISetting">Mean Threshold</span> (RPi only).
								This specifies how close the actual mean brightness must be to the
								<span class="WebUISetting">Mean Target</span>.
								For example, if <span class="WebUISetting">Mean Target<span> is 0.5 and
										<span class="WebUISetting">Mean Threshold<span> is 0.1,
												the actual mean can vary between 0.4 and 0.6 (0.5 +/- 0.1).
							<li>The <span class="WebUISetting">Focus Metric</span> setting is now available for ZWO
								cameras.
								Higher numbers indicate better focus.
								Use only when sky conditions are NOT changing.
						</ul>
					<li><strong>NOTE</strong>: the following settings moved from
						<span class="fileName">config.sh</span> to the WebUI,
						and are "advanced" options so you'll need to click the "Show Advanced Options" button to see
						them:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li><span class="shSetting">DAYTIME_CAPTURE</span> is now
								<span class="WebUISetting">Take Daytime Images</span> in the WebUI.
							<li><span class="shSetting">DAYTIME_SAVE</span> is
								<span class="WebUISetting">Save Daytime Images</span>.
							<li><span class="shSetting">DARK_CAPTURE</span> is
								<span class="WebUISetting">Take Dark Frames</span>.
							<li><span class="shSetting">DARK_FRAME_SUBTRACTION</span> is
								<span class="WebUISetting">Use Dark Frames</span>.
						</ul>
					<li> <span class="WebUISetting">Debug Level</span> is more consistent:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li> 0: errors only.
							<li> 1: level 0 plus warnings and messages about taking and saving pictures. This is the
								default.
							<li> 2: level 1 plus details on images captured, sleep messages and the like.
							<li> 3: level 2 plus time to save image, details on exposure settings and capture retries,
								and module execution.
							<li> 4: lots of gory details for developers only.
						</ul>
					<li> System messages appear at the top of the WebUI whenever you need to take an action.
					<li> Many minor enhancements were made.
				</ul>


				<h4>Allsky Website</h4>
				<ul>
					<li> The Allsky Website is now installed in <span class="fileName">~/allsky/html/allsky</span>.
					<li> If an older version of the Website is found during Website installation you'll be prompted
						to have its images and settings moved to the new location.
					<li> The home page can be customized:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li> You can specify the order, contents, look, and style of the icons on the left side.
								You can also hide an icon or display a new one.
							<li> You can specify the order, contents, and style of the popout that appears on the right
								side.
								For example, you can add a link to pictures of your allsky camera.
							<li> You can set a background image.
							<li> You can easily change the maximum width of the image.
							<li> You can add a link to a personal website.
								This link appears at the top of the page.
							<li> You can add a border around the image to have it stand out on the page.
							<li> You can hide the "Make Your Own" link on the bottom right of the page.
							<li> You can change the icon that appears on the browser's tab.
							<li> See the Allsky Website documentation for other customizations you can make.
						</ul>
					<li> Left sidebar:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li> The constellation overlay icon (Casseopeia icon) is hidden by default and should only
								be displayed
								after you've set the overlay to match your stars.
							<li> If you are creating mini-timelapse videos, when you install the Website an icon for the
								current video will appear on the left side.
								You can also manually show/hide the icon.
							<li> There's a new icon to display the image full-size.
							<li> The startrails and information icons were updated.
						</ul>
					<li> Popout on right side:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li> A link to your <strong>Image Settings</strong> can optionally be displayed via the
								<span class="WebUISetting">Display Settings</span> option in the WebUI.
							<li> The version of Allsky and the Allsky Website are displayed.
						</ul>
					<li> Timelapse video thumbnails are now created by default on the Pi and uploaded to a remote
						server.
						This resolves issues with remote servers that don't support creating thumbnails.
						See the <span class="shSetting">TIMELAPSE_UPLOAD_THUMBNAIL</span> setting.
					<li> Configuration file changes:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li> The two prior configuration files (<span class="fileName">config.js</span> and
								<span class="fileName">virtualsky.json</span>) are replaced by <span
									class="fileName">configuration.json</span>.
							<li> There are several new settings, including the ability to specify the opacity of the
								overlay.
							<li> The <span class="editorSetting">overlaySize</span> setting,
								which defined both the width and the height of the constellation overlay, was split into
								<span class="editorSetting">overlayWidth</span> and <span
									class="editorSetting">overlayHeight</span>.
								Having separate values can be helpful when trying to get the overlay to line up with the
								actual stars.
							<li> The WebUI <span class="WebUILink">Editor</span> page must be used to edit the Allsky
								Website's
								configuration file since it performs various checks before updating the configuration.
							<li> The <span class="WebUILink">Editor</span> page should also be used to edit a REMOTE
								Allsky Website's configuration file for the same reason.s
								A master copy of the remote server's <span class="fileName">configuration.json</span>
								is kept on the Pi and automatically re-uploaded to the server after every change.
								After you do this, the drop-down list on the <span class="WebUILink">Editor</span> page
								will now have
								<span class="fileName">configuration.json (remote Allsky Website)</span> to distinguish
								it from a local Website's file.
								See the Allsky Website Installation documentation for details.
						</ul>

					<li>Added/changed/deleted settings (in <span class="fileName">config.sh</span> unless otherwise
						noted):
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li>Added <span class="shSetting">WEBUI_DATA_FILES</span> - contains the name of one or more
								files that contain information to
								be added to the WebUI's <span class="WebUILink">System</span> page.
								See <a external="true"
									href="https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky/wiki/WEBUI_DATA_FILES">this Wiki
									page</a> for more information.
							<li>Renamed <span class="shSetting">NIGHTS_TO_KEEP</span> to <span
									class="shSetting">DAYS_TO_KEEP</span> since it determines
								how many days of data to keep, not just nighttime data.
								If blank (<code>""</code>), ALL days' data are kept.
							<li>Deleted <span class="shSetting">AUTO_DELETE</span> - its functionality is now in <span
									class="shSetting">DAYS_TO_KEEP</span>.
								<span class="shSetting">DAYS_TO_KEEP=""</span> is similar to the old <span
									class="shSetting">AUTO_DELETE=false</span>.
							<li>Added <span class="shSetting">WEB_DAYS_TO_KEEP</span> - specifies how many days of
								Allsky Website images and
								videos to keep, if the website is installed on your Pi.
							<li>Added <span class="shSetting">WEB_IMAGE_DIR</span> in <span
									class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span> to allow the
								images to be copied to a location on your Pi (usually the Allsky Website) as well as
								being copied to a remote machine.
								This functionality already existed with timelapse, startrails, and keogram files.
						</ul>
					<li>The RPi camera now supports all the text overlay features as the ZWO camera,
						including the <span class="WebUISetting">Extra Text</span> file.
					<li>Removed the harmless "deprecated pixel format used" message from the timelapse log file.
						That message only confused people.
					<li>Improved the auto-exposure for RPi cameras.
					<li>Made numerous changes to the ZWO and RPi camera's code that will make it easier to maintain and
						add new features in the future.
					<li>If Allsky is stopped or restarted while a file is being uploaded to a remote server,
						the upload continues, eliminating cases where a temporary file would be left on the server.
					<li>Decreased other cases where temporary files would be left on remote servers during uploads.
						Also, uploads now perform additional error checking to help in debugging.
					<li>Only one upload can now be done at a time.
						Any additional uploads display a message in the log file and then exit.
						This should eliminate (or signifiantly decrease) cases where a file is overwritten or not found,
						resulting in an error message or a temporary file left on the server.
					<li>Added a <code>--debug</code> option to <code>allsky/scripts/upload.sh</code> to aid in debugging
						uploads.
					<li>Upload log files are only created if there was an error; this saves writes to SD cards.
					<li>The <code>removeBadImages.sh</code> script also only creates a log file if there was an error,
						which saves one write to the SD card <em>for every image</em>.
					<li>Allsky now stops with an error message on unrecoverable errors (e.g., no camera found).
						It used to keep restarting and failing forever.
					<li>More meaningful messages are displayed as images.
						For example, in most cases "<strong>ERROR. See /var/log/allsky.log</strong>" messages have been
						replaced
						with messages containing additional information, for example,
						"<strong>*** ERROR *** Allsky Stopped! ZWO camera not found!</strong>".
					<li>If Allsky is restarted, a new "Allsky software is restarting" message is displayed,
						instead of a "stopping" followed by "starting" message.
					<li>The timelapse debug output no longer includes one line for each of several thousand images
						proced.
						This make it easier to see any actual errors.
					<li>The <span class=WebUILink">Camera Settings</span> page of the WebUI now displays the minimum,
						maximum,
						and default values in a popup for numerical fields.
					<li>Startrails and Keogram creation no longer crash if invalid files are found.
					<li>Removed the <span class="fileName">allsky/scripts/filename.sh</span> file.
					<li>The RPi <span class="WebUISetting">Gamma</span> value in the WebUI was renamed to <span
							class="WebUISetting">Saturation</span>,
						which is what it always adjusted; <span class="WebUISetting">Gamma</span> was incorrect.
					<li>Known issues:
						<ul class="minimalPadding">
							<li>The startrails and keogram programs don't work well if you bin differently during the
								day and night.
								If you don't save daytime images this won't be a problem.
							<li>The minimum, maximum, and default values in the <span class="WebUILink">Camera
									Settings</span> page of the WebUI,
								especially for the RPi camera, aren't always correct.
								This is especially try if running on the Bullseye operating system, where many of the
								settings changed.

							<li><span class="shSetting">IMG_CREATE_THUMBNAILS</span> specifies whether or not thumbnails
								should be created for each image.
							<li><span class="shSetting">REMOVE_BAD_IMAGES</span> now defaults to "true" since bad-image
								detection is now done after a
								picture is saved rather than once for all pictures at the end of the night.
								This helps decrease problems when creating startrails, keograms, and timelapse videos.
							<li><span class="shSetting">IMG_PREFIX</span>: no longer used - the name of the image used
								by the websites is now
								whatever you specify in the WebUI (default: <span class="fileName">image.jpg</span>).

						thereby eliminating the need for the <span class="fileName">temperature.txt</span> file.
					<li>The image used by the websites (default: <span class="fileName">image.jpg</span>)
						as well as all temporary files are now written to <span class="fileName">allsky/tmp</span>.
