<h2>v2023.05.01 - Current Release</h2>
<details><summary></summary>

<h4>Core Allsky</h4>
<ul>
	<li>New camera support:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
			<li>All ZWO cameras as of May 1, 2023.
			<li>RPi HQ and Module 3 cameras.
			<li>ArduCam 16 and 64 MP cameras.
			<li>The RPi "Global Shutter Camera" is NOT supported - high speed shutters aren't useful for allsky images.
		</ul>
	<li>"Mini" timelapse videos can be created that contain a user-configurable
		number of the most recent images.
		This allows you to continually see the recent sky conditions.
	<li>Installation improvements:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
			<li>If there is not enough swap space configured you are prompted to add more.
				Doing this decreases the chance of timelapse creation problems.
			<li>If <span class="fileName">allsky/tmp</span> is not a memory-resident
				filesystem you are prompted to make it one.
				This SIGNIFICANTLY decreases the number of writes to the SD card, prolonging its life.			
			<li>If a <span class="fileName">~/allsky-OLD</span> directory is found it's
				assumed to be a prior release of Allsky and you are prompted to have its images,
				darks, and other items moved to the new release.
				See the <a allsky="true" external="true" href="installation/Allsky.html">Installing / Upgrading -&gt; Allsky</a>
				page for instructions for installing this release.
		</ul>
	<li><code>scripts/check_allsky.sh</code> was added to perform basic sanity
		checking of your Allsky installation.
		Run it after you're done configuring Allsky to see if you have any issues.
	<li><span class="WebUISetting">latitude</span> and <span class="WebUISetting">longitude</span>
		can now be specified as either a decimal number
		(e.g., <code>-105.21</code>) or with N, S, E, W (e.g., <code>105.21W</code>).
	<li>Removed several settings from <span class="fileName">config.sh</span>:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
			<li><span class="shSetting">CAMERA</span>: To update the camera type, use the new
				<span class="WebUISetting">Camera Type</span> setting in the WebUI.
				This is an advanced setting so you need to click the "Show Advanced Options" button to view it.
			<li><span class="shSetting">POST_END_OF_NIGHT_DATA</span> is no longer needed since
				Allsky automatically determines if you have a local Allsky Website, a remote one, or both.
		</ul>
	<li>New ftp-settings.sh variables:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
			<li><span class="shSetting">REMOTE_PORT</span> specifies a non-default FTP port.
			<li><span class="shSetting">SSH_KEY_FILE</span> is the path to an SSH private key.
				When <span class="editorString">scp</span> is used for uploads,
				this identify file will be used to establish the secure connection.
			<li>The Secure CP (<span class="editorString">scp</span>) and Google Cloud Service
				(<span class="editorString">gcs</span>) protocols are now supported for file uploads.
		</ul>
	<li>The Wiki now points to files in the GitHub <span class="fileNamw">documentation</span> directory.
		A copy of that directory is also on the Pi and accessible via the Documentation link in the WebUI.
	<li>The Allsky Documentation has been <strong>significantly</strong> enhanced and expanded.
		Its goal is to be a single source for everything you need to know about Allsky.
		If you don't know how to do something, look it up.
		If it's not in the documentation, let us know.
	<li><span class="shSetting">AUTO_STRETCH</span> now works, and is documented with sample images.
	<li>Images can now be uploaded using the full <span class="fileNamw">image-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.jpg</span>
		name instead of the shorter <span class="fileName">image.jpg</span> name.
		See the <span class="shSetting">IMG_UPLOAD_ORIGINAL_NAME</span> Allsky setting in the documentation.
	<li>Many minor enhancements and bug fixes were made.
</ul>


<h4>WebUI</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The WebUI is now installed as part of the Allsky installation and <strong>must</strong> be
		used to make all settings changes.
		<blockquote>
		The <a external="true" href="https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky-portal">allsky-portal</a>
		repository will be removed as it is no longer needed.
		</blockquote>
	<li>New links on the left side of the WebUI:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
			<li><span class="WebUILink">Overlay Editor</span> allows you to drag and drop the text
				and images you want overlayed on the images.
				This is a <strong>significant</strong> improvement over the old mechanism and lets you
				vary the font size, color, rotation, etc. for everything you add.
				You can use variables in the text which get replaced at run-time, e.g., the time the image was taken.
			<li><span class="WebUILink">Module Manager</span> allows you to specify what actions should
				take place after an image has been saved.
				For example you can add an overlay or count the number of stars or periodically control a dew heater.
				Users can develop (and hopefully share) their own modules.
				Full notes on how to <a allsky="true" external="true" href="modules/modules.html">develop modules</a>
				is included in the documentation.
			<li>The <span class=">WebUILink">Allsky Documentation</span>
				link accesses the documentation on your Pi.
		</ul>
	<li>Minimum, maximum, and default values are now correct for all camera models.
	<li>Required fields with missing data are shown in red with a message saying the data is missing.
		For example, <span class="WebUISetting">Latitude</span> is a required field.
	<li>New settings on the <span class="WebUILink">Allsky Settings</span> page:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
			<li><span class="WebUISetting">Camera Type</span> is either ZWO or RPi.
				This replaces the <span class="shSetting">CAMERA</span> variable in the
				<span class="fileName">config.sh</span>
				file and also allows you to switch between cameras connected to the Pi.
				For example, if you have both an RPi and ZWO camera attached, you can switch between them using this setting.
			<li><span class="WebUISetting">Max Auto-Exposure</span> for day and night.
				When using auto-exposure, exposure times will not exceed this value.
			<li><span class="WebUISetting">Max Auto-Gain</span> for day and night.
				When using auto-gain, gain values will not exceed this value.
			<li><span class="WebUISetting">Auto White Balance</span>, <span class="WebUISetting">Red Balance</span>,
				and <span class="WebUISetting">Blue Balance</span> are now available for day and night.
			<li><span class="WebUISetting">Frames to Skip</span> for day and night determine how many initial
				auto-exposure frames to ignore when starting Allsky, while the auto-exposure
				algorithm homes in on the correct exposure.
				These frames are often over or under exposed so not worth saving anyhow.
			<li><span class="WebUISetting">Consistent Delays</span> determines whether or not the time between the start of
				exposures will be consistent (current behavior) or not.
				When enabled, the time between images is the maximum exposure time plus the delay you set.
			<li><span class="WebUISetting">Overlay Method</span> determines if the text overlay (exposure, time, etc.)
				should be done by the legacy program or by the new "module" system (see above).
				<blockquote>The default method will change to the module method in the next release of Allsky,
				and after that the legacy overlay method will be removed.
				</blockquote>
			<li><span class="WebUISetting">Require WebUI Login</span> specifies whether
				or not the WebUI should require you to login.
				Only set this to <span class="WebUIValue">No</span>
				if your Pi is on a local network and you trust everyone on the network.
				<strong>Do NOT disable it if your Pi is accessible via the Internet!</strong>
			<li><span class="WebUISetting">Cooling</span> and <span class="WebUISetting">Target Temp.</span>
				(ZWO only) now have separate settings for day and night.
			<li><span class="WebUISetting">Aggression</span> (ZWO only)
				determines how much of a calculated exposure change should be applied.
				This helps smooth out brightness changes, for example, when a car's headlights appear in one frame.
			<li><span class="WebUISetting">Gamma</span> (ZWO only) changes the contrast of an image.
				It is only supported by a few cameras; for those that don't,
				the <span class="shSetting">AUTO_STRETCH</span> setting can produce a similar effect.
			<li><span class="WebUISetting">Offset</span> (ZWO only)
				adds about 1/10th the specified amount to each pixel's brightness,
				thereby brightening the whole image.
				etting this too high causes the image to turn gray.
			<li><span class="WebUISetting">Contrast</span> and
				<span class="WebUISetting">Sharpness</span>(RPi only).
			<li><span class="WebUISetting">Extra Parameters</span> (RPi only) replaces the
				<span class="shSetting">CAPTURE_EXTRA_PARAMETERS</span>
				variable in the <span class="fileName">config.sh</span> file,
				and allows you to pass parameters to the <code>libcamera-still</code>
				image capture program that Allsky doesn't natively support, such as auto-focus options.
			<li><span class="WebUISetting">Mean Target</span> (RPi only) for day and night.
				This specifies the mean target brightness (0.0 (pure black) to
				1.0 (pure white)) when in auto-exposure mode.
			<li><span class="WebUISetting">Mean Threshold</span> (RPi only).
				This specifies how close the actual mean brightness must be to the
				<span class="WebUISetting">Mean Target</span>.
				For example, if <span class="WebUISetting">Mean Target<span> is 0.5 and
				<span class="WebUISetting">Mean Threshold<span> is 0.1,
				the actual mean can vary between 0.4 and 0.6 (0.5 +/- 0.1).			
			<li>The <span class="WebUISetting">Focus Metric</span> setting is now available for ZWO cameras.
				Higher numbers indicate better focus.
				Use only when sky conditions are NOT changing.
		</ul>
	<li><strong>NOTE</strong>: the following settings moved from
		<span class="fileName">config.sh</span> to the WebUI,
		and are "advanced" options so you'll need to click the "Show Advanced Options" button to see them:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
			<li><span class="shSetting">DAYTIME_CAPTURE</span> is now
				<span class="WebUISetting">Take Daytime Images</span> in the WebUI.
			<li><span class="shSetting">DAYTIME_SAVE</span> is
				<span class="WebUISetting">Save Daytime Images</span>.
			<li><span class="shSetting">DARK_CAPTURE</span> is
				<span class="WebUISetting">Take Dark Frames</span>.
			<li><span class="shSetting">DARK_FRAME_SUBTRACTION</span> is
				<span class="WebUISetting">Use Dark Frames</span>.
		</ul>
	<li> <span class="WebUISetting">Debug Level</span> is more consistent:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
			<li> 0: errors only.
			<li> 1: level 0 plus warnings and messages about taking and saving pictures.  This is the default.
			<li> 2: level 1 plus details on images captured, sleep messages and the like.
			<li> 3: level 2 plus time to save image, details on exposure settings and capture retries, and module execution.
			<li> 4: lots of gory details for developers only.
		</ul>
	<li> System messages appear at the top of the WebUI whenever you need to take an action.
	<li> Many minor enhancements were made.
</ul>


<h4>Allsky Website</h4>
<ul>
	<li> The Allsky Website is now installed in <span class="fileName">~/allsky/html/allsky</span>.
	<li> If an older version of the Website is found during Website installation you'll be prompted
		to have its images and settings moved to the new location.
	<li> The home page can be customized:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
			<li> You can specify the order, contents, look, and style of the icons on the left side.
				You can also hide an icon or display a new one.
			<li> You can specify the order, contents, and style of the popout that appears on the right side.
				For example, you can add a link to pictures of your allsky camera.
			<li> You can set a background image.
			<li> You can easily change the maximum width of the image.
			<li> You can add a link to a personal website.
				This link appears at the top of the page.
			<li> You can add a border around the image to have it stand out on the page.
			<li> You can hide the "Make Your Own" link on the bottom right of the page.
			<li> You can change the icon that appears on the browser's tab.
			<li> See the Allsky Website documentation for other customizations you can make.
		</ul>
	<li> Left sidebar:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
			<li> The constellation overlay icon (Casseopeia icon) is hidden by default and should only be displayed
				after you've set the overlay to match your stars.
			<li> If you are creating mini-timelapse videos, when you install the Website an icon for the current video will appear on the left side.
				You can also manually show/hide the icon.
			<li> There's a new icon to display the image full-size.
			<li> The startrails and information icons were updated.
		</ul>
	<li> Popout on right side:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
			<li> A link to your <strong>Image Settings</strong> can optionally be displayed via the
			<span class="WebUISetting">Display Settings</span> option in the WebUI.
			<li> The version of Allsky and the Allsky Website are displayed.
		</ul>
	<li> Timelapse video thumbnails are now created by default on the Pi and uploaded to a remote server.
		This resolves issues with remote servers that don't support creating thumbnails.
		See the <span class="shSetting">TIMELAPSE_UPLOAD_THUMBNAIL</span> setting.
	<li> Configuration file changes:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
			<li> The two prior configuration files (<span class="fileName">config.js</span> and
				<span class="fileName">virtualsky.json</span>) are replaced by <span class="fileName">configuration.json</span>.
			<li> There are several new settings, including the ability to specify the opacity of the overlay.		
			<li> The <span class="editorSetting">overlaySize</span> setting,
				which defined both the width and the height of the constellation overlay, was split into
				<span class="editorSetting">overlayWidth</span> and <span class="editorSetting">overlayHeight</span>.
				Having separate values can be helpful when trying to get the overlay to line up with the actual stars.
			<li> The WebUI <span class="WebUILink">Editor</span> page must be used to edit the Allsky Website's
				configuration file since it performs various checks before updating the configuration.
			<li> The <span class="WebUILink">Editor</span> page should also be used to edit a REMOTE Allsky Website's configuration file for the same reason.s
				A master copy of the remote server's <span class="fileName">configuration.json</span>
				is kept on the Pi and automatically re-uploaded to the server after every change.
				After you do this, the drop-down list on the <span class="WebUILink">Editor</span> page will now have
				<span class="fileName">configuration.json (remote Allsky Website)</span> to distinguish it from a local Website's file.
				See the Allsky Website Installation documentation for details.
		</ul>
</ul>

<h2>v2022.03.01</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li>Switched to date-based release names.
	<li>Added ability to have your allsky camera added to the
		<a external="true" href="http://www.thomasjacquin.com/allsky-map">Allsky Map</a> by configuring
		<a external="true" href="https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky/wiki/allsky-Settings/_edit#map-settings">these settings</a>.
		Added <strong>Allsky Map Setup</strong> section to the WebUI to configure the map settings.
		The <span class="WebUISetting">Lens</span> field now shows in the popout on the Allsky Website (if installed).
	<li>Significantly enhanced Wiki - more pages and more information on existing pages.
		All known issues are described there as well as fixes / workarounds.
	<li>Added an option to keograms to make them full width, even if few images were used in creating the keogram.
		In <span class="fileName">config.sh</span>, set <span class="shSetting">KEOGRAM_EXTRA_PARAMETERS="--image-expand"</span>.
	<li>Added/changed/deleted settings (in <span class="fileName">config.sh</span> unless otherwise noted):
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
	  		<li>Added <span class="shSetting">WEBUI_DATA_FILES</span> - contains the name of one or more files that contain information to
				be added to the WebUI's <span class="WebUILink">System</span> page.
				See <a external="true" href="https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky/wiki/WEBUI_DATA_FILES">this Wiki page</a> for more information.
	  		<li>Renamed <span class="shSetting">NIGHTS_TO_KEEP</span> to <span class="shSetting">DAYS_TO_KEEP</span> since it determines
				how many days of data to keep, not just nighttime data.
				If blank (<code>""</code>), ALL days' data are kept.
	  		<li>Deleted <span class="shSetting">AUTO_DELETE</span> - its functionality is now in <span class="shSetting">DAYS_TO_KEEP</span>.
				<span class="shSetting">DAYS_TO_KEEP=""</span> is similar to the old <span class="shSetting">AUTO_DELETE=false</span>.
	  		<li>Added <span class="shSetting">WEB_DAYS_TO_KEEP</span> - specifies how many days of Allsky Website images and
				videos to keep, if the website is installed on your Pi.
	  		<li>Added <span class="shSetting">WEB_IMAGE_DIR</span> in <span class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span> to allow the
				images to be copied to a location on your Pi (usually the Allsky Website) as well as being copied to a remote machine.
				This functionality already existed with timelapse, startrails, and keogram files.
		</ul>
	<li>The RPi camera now supports all the text overlay features as the ZWO camera,
		including the <span class="WebUISetting">Extra Text</span> file.
	<li>Removed the harmless "deprecated pixel format used" message from the timelapse log file.
		That message only confused people.
	<li>Improved the auto-exposure for RPi cameras.
	<li>Made numerous changes to the ZWO and RPi camera's code that will make it easier to maintain and add new features in the future.
	<li>If Allsky is stopped or restarted while a file is being uploaded to a remote server,
		the upload continues, eliminating cases where a temporary file would be left on the server.
	<li>Decreased other cases where temporary files would be left on remote servers during uploads.
		Also, uploads now perform additional error checking to help in debugging.
	<li>Only one upload can now be done at a time.
		Any additional uploads display a message in the log file and then exit.
		This should eliminate (or signifiantly decrease) cases where a file is overwritten or not found,
		resulting in an error message or a temporary file left on the server.
	<li>Added a <code>--debug</code> option to <code>allsky/scripts/upload.sh</code> to aid in debugging uploads.
	<li>Upload log files are only created if there was an error; this saves writes to SD cards.
	<li>The <code>removeBadImages.sh</code> script also only creates a log file if there was an error,
		which saves one write to the SD card <em>for every image</em>.
	<li>Allsky now stops with an error message on unrecoverable errors (e.g., no camera found).
		It used to keep restarting and failing forever.
	<li>More meaningful messages are displayed as images.
		For example, in most cases "<strong>ERROR.  See /var/log/allsky.log</strong>" messages have been replaced
		with messages containing additional information, for example,
		"<strong>*** ERROR ***  Allsky Stopped!  ZWO camera not found!</strong>".
	<li>If Allsky is restarted, a new "Allsky software is restarting" message is displayed,
		instead of a "stopping" followed by "starting" message.
	<li>The timelapse debug output no longer includes one line for each of several thousand images proced.
		This make it easier to see any actual errors.
	<li>The <span class=WebUILink">Camera Settings</span> page of the WebUI now displays the minimum, maximum,
		and default values in a popup for numerical fields.
	<li>Startrails and Keogram creation no longer crash if invalid files are found.
	<li>Removed the <span class="fileName">allsky/scripts/filename.sh</span> file.
	<li>The RPi <span class="WebUISetting">Gamma</span> value in the WebUI was renamed to <span class="WebUISetting">Saturation</span>,
		which is what it always adjusted; <span class="WebUISetting">Gamma</span> was incorrect.
	<li>Known issues:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
	  		<li>The startrails and keogram programs don't work well if you bin differently during the day and night.
				If you don't save daytime images this won't be a problem.
	  		<li>The minimum, maximum, and default values in the <span class="WebUILink">Camera Settings</span> page of the WebUI,
				especially for the RPi camera, aren't always correct.
				This is especially try if running on the Bullseye operating system, where many of the settings changed.
		</ul>
</ul>
</details>


<h2>0.8.3</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li>Works on Bullseye operating system.
	<li>RPi version:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
	  		<li>Has an improved auto-exposure algorithm.
				To use it, set <span class="shSetting">CAPTURE_EXTRA_PARAMETERS</span>=<span class="editorSetting">"-daymean 0.5 -nightmean 0.2"</span>
				in <span class="fileName">config.sh</span>.
	  		<li>Has many new settings including support for most of the text overlay features that are supported by the ZWO version.
		</ul>
	<li>New and changed <span class="fileName">config.sh</span> variables,
			see the <a external="true" href="https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky/wiki/allsky-Settings">Software Settings</a> Wiki page for more information:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
	  		<li><span class="shSetting">IMG_UPLOAD_FREQUENCY</span> specifies how often the image should be uploaded to a website.
				Useful with slow uplinks or metered Internet connections.
	  		<li><span class="shSetting">IMG_CREATE_THUMBNAILS</span> specifies whether or not thumbnails should be created for each image.
	  		<li><span class="shSetting">REMOVE_BAD_IMAGES</span> now defaults to "true" since bad-image detection is now done after a
				picture is saved rather than once for all pictures at the end of the night.
				This helps decrease problems when creating startrails, keograms, and timelapse videos.
	  		<li><span class="shSetting">IMG_PREFIX</span>: no longer used - the name of the image used by the websites is now
				whatever you specify in the WebUI (default: <span class="fileName">image.jpg</span>).
	  		<li><blockquote>When upgrading to 0.8.3 you MUST follow the steps listed
				<a external="true" href="https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky/wiki/Upgrade-from-0.8.2-or-prior-versions">here</a>.
				</blockquote>
		</ul>
	<li>Replaced <code>saveImageDay.sh</code> and <code>saveImageNight.sh</code> with
		<code>saveImage.sh</code> that has improved functionality,
		including passing the sensor temperature to the dark subtraction commands,
		thereby eliminating the need for the <span class="fileName">temperature.txt</span> file.
	<li>The image used by the websites (default: <span class="fileName">image.jpg</span>)
		as well as all temporary files are now written to <span class="fileName">allsky/tmp</span>.
		<blockquote>If you are using the Allsky Website you will need to change the
		<span class="editorSetting">imageName</span> variable in
		<span class="fileName">/var/www/html/allsky/config.js</span> to
		<span class="fileName">"/current/tmp/image.jpg"</span>.</blockquote>
	<li>You can <strong>significanly</strong> reduce wear on your SD card by making <span class="fileName">allsky/tmp</span>
		a <a external="true" href="https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky/wiki/Miscellaneous-Tips">memory-based filesystem</a>.
</ul>
</details>


<h2>0.8.1</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li>Rearranged the directory structure.
	<li>Created a Wiki with additional documentation and troubleshooting tips.
	<li>Renamed several variables in <span class="fileName">config.sh</span> and <span class="fileName">ftp-settings.sh</span>.
	<li><span class="shSetting">CAMERA</span> type of "auto" is no longer supported - you must specify "ZWO" or "RPi".
	<li>Startrails and keograms are now created using all CPUs on the Pi, drastically speeding up creation time.
	<li>Installing the WebUI now preserves any website files (keograms, startrails, etc.) you have.
		This allows for non-destructive updates of the WebUI.
	<li>New script called <code>upload.sh</code> centralizes all the upload code from other scripts,
		and can be used to debug uploading issues.
		See <a external="true" href="https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky/wiki/Troubleshooting:-uploads">this Wiki page</a> for more information.
	<li>The RPi camera does much better auto-exposure if you set the <code>-mode-mean</code> and <code>-autoexposure</code> options.
	<li>The WebUI will now show the Pi's throttle and low-voltage states, which is useful for debugging.
	<li>Darks work better.
	<li>Many bug fixes, error checks, and warnings added.
</ul>
</details>


<h2>0.8</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li>Workaround for ZWO daytime autoexposure bug.
	<li>Improved exposure transitions between day and night so there's not such a huge change in brightness.
	<li>Decrease in ZWO sensor temperature.
	<li>Lots of new settings, including splitting some settings into day and night versions.
