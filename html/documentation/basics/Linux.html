<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
This page is for people will little or no Linux experience.
It won't make you a guru,
but should give you enough information to install and use the Allsky software.
If you are new to the Raspberry Pi you may want to view the
<a allsky="true" href="Pi.html">Pi Basics</a>.
</p>
<p>
To keep the other Allsky documentation pages a manageable length,
they assume you have basic Linux and Pi knowledge.
For example, you know how to log into the Pi, move around to various directories,
view and edit files, and execute commands.
</p>
<p>
To get information on any Linux command, enter <code>man <i>command_name</i></code>,
for example, <code>man date</code>.
</p>

<h2>Linux Desktop</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Linux is similar in many ways to Windows and MacOS - they
all have a Desktop as well as a command-line interface (also called a "terminal window").
Most of the interactions you'll have with your Pi for Allsky-related tasks
will be via the command-line (or via the WebUI),
whereas in Windows and MacOS the terminal window is rarely used.
</p>
<p>
The screenshot below shows a typical Linux desktop.
Starting from the far left are 5 icons followed by a file explore window and
a terminal window showing the output of the <code>date</code> command.
At the bottom is the taskbar - very similar to Windows and MacOS.

<h2>Terminal Window</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
A Terminal Window emulates the old ASCII-based character-only terminals.
Notice the one above has no graphics - only characters.
It prompts for commands to enter, so is also called a "command-line interface".
Whereas Windows has one primary command-line interpreter
(called <code>cmd</code>, which looks like a DOS window),
Linus has multiple interpreters, called "shells".
When UNIX was first invented in the late 1960s, the only shell available was <code>sh</code>.
Since then, many other shells have been created; the one Allsky uses is <code>bash</code>
since it has many useful features not in <code>sh</code>.
You'll notice the commands in the <span class="fileName">allsky/scripts</span> directory have an
extension of <code>.sh</code> which signifies they are shell scripts.
Unlike in Windows, Linux commands don't actually need an extension,
but all the Allsky text-based commands have extensions so it's obvious what type of file it is.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the Allsky documentation you'll see instructions like:
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 50px">
Execute the following:
<pre>
cd
ls -l
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The <code>cd</code> and <code>ls -l</code> commands should be executed at the command-line.
</p>
<blockquote>
Because Allsky commands are executed on the command-line,
this page only mentions the commands to execute to perform an action,
and ignores any associated desktop icon that performs the same action.
</blockquote>
</details>

<h2>Logging in</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
There are several ways you can log into a Pi.
<ol>
<li>
<b>On the console</b>, with a keyboard, mouse, and monitor plugged directly into the Pi.
Although this is the easiest way, it requires that you have access to the Pi,
which when used with an allsky camera is rarely the case,
except when you're initially setting up the Pi.
<li>
The Pi comes with a <b>VNC</b> (Virtual Network Connection) server,
so you can access the Pi remotely by installing a VNC client on your
PC, phone, tablet, or almost any other device.
When using the VNC client, you see your Pi desktop and interact with it as if you
were directly attached to the Pi.
<li>
<b>SSH</b> (<u>s</u>ecure <u>sh</u>ell) is used to log into the Pi from a remote devices,
usually a PC or Mac but could be a tablet or phone.
SSH needs to be enabled on the Pi - the easiest way is when using the
"Raspberry Pi Imager" to create the intial Raspberry Pi OS.
Once SSH is enabled, do the following to use it:
<ol>
	<li>On the remote device, open a terminal window
		(<code>cmd</code> on Windows or <code>terminal</code> on Mac)
	<li>Type <code>ssh pi@allsky.local</code>.
	<li>Enter the password when prompted.
	<li>You can now enter Linux commands.
</ol>
<br><span style="color: red">NEED MORE INFO</span>
</ol>
</p>
</details>


<h2>Executing commands</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
To execute a command you simply type it's name followed by any optional arguments:
<pre>
date
sudo systemctl start allsky
</pre>
In this example, <code>date</code> and <code>sudo</code> are the names of commands.
<code>date</code> has no arguments and <code>sudo</code> has 3 arguments.
<h3>Permissions</h3>
Just like in other operating systems, files and commands have permissions that determines who
can view, edit, and execute them.
By default, when you login to the Pi, you are running as the "pi" login,
which has limited permissions, e.g., it generally can't update system files.
In Linux, the "root" login ("admin" in Windows) can do anything.
<br>
In the example above, the <code>date</code> command can be executed by anyone but
the <code>systemctl</code> command can only be executed by the "root" login.
The <code>sudo</code> command runs its first argument (<code>systemctl</code>) as "root"
and passes the last 2 arguments to <code>systemctl</code>.
</p>
<blockquote>
An interesting fact - the "root" login is also called "<u>s</u>uper <u>u</u>ser",
hence <code><u>su</u>do</code> - "super user do".
</blockquote>
If an argument contains a space or other "special characters", it must be quoted,
otherwise it's treated as multiple arguments:
<pre>
echo "Hello world!"
echo         "Hello world!"
</pre>

<p>
Note the first line above has a single space between <code>echo</code> and the argument
and the second line has several spaces.
Those spaces are considered "white space", and unless quoted,
the shell doesn't care if there's one white space or a million.
Hence, both the lines above are treated the same.
<br>
What happens if you don't included that white space?
The shell will look for a command called <code>echoHello world!</code>
which of course doesn't exist and you'll get an error message.
<br>
What's the difference in these?
<pre>
echo "Hello world!"
echo "Hello    world!"
</pre>
</p>
</details>

<h2>Moving around the filesystem</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Windows has multiple "drives", each with its own letter, e.g., C:, D:, etc., and each drive
has a topmost, or "root" directory, called <span class="fileName">\</span>,
e.g., <span class="fileName">C:\</span>.
Linux does not use drive letters but has a single "root" directory,
called <span class="fileName">/</span>.
Note that the characters <span class="fileName">\</span> and
<span class="fileName">/</span> also separate directories,
for example:
<span class="fileName">/home/pi/allsky</span>
<br>
The above string is called a "path name" since it names the path to a file or directory,
in this case, the "allsky" directory.
<ul>
<li>The first <span class="fileName">/</span> is the root directory.
<li><span class="fileName">home</span> is a directory under the root directory, and contains home directories for
	all the users on your Pi (on most machines, just the "pi" login).
<li>The second and third <span class="fileName">/</span> characters separate directories.
<li><span class="fileName">pi</span> is a sub-directory in the
<span class="fileName">home</span> directory that contains all the "pi"
	login's files and directories and is called pi's HOME directory.
<li><span class="fileName">allsky</span> is the name of a directory that contains
most of the Allsky files, images, etc.
</ul>
<p>
To move from one location to another, use the <code>cd</code>
(<u>c</u>hange <u>d</u>irectory) command.
In the examples below, it's assumed you're logged in as "pi",
<code>~</code> stands for pi's HOME directory,
and anything after the "#" is a shell comment.
<pre>
cd           <span class="pl-c"># goes to the HOME directory of whatever login you are</span>
cd ~/allsky  <span class="pl-c"># goes to pi's "allsky" directory</span>
cd /         <span class="pl-c"># goes to the root directory</span>
cd -         <span class="pl-c"># goes to the previous directory</span>
cd ../..     <span class="pl-c"># goes up two directories - ".." is called a "parent" directory</span>
pwd          <span class="pl-c"># displays the current or working directory - <u>p</u>rint <u>w</u>orking <u>d</u>irectory</span>
</pre>
</p>
</details>

<h2>Listing files and directories</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
To see the contents of a directory, type <code>ls</code> (<u>l</u>ist file<u>s</u>)
(called <code>dir</code> in Windows).
Like most commands, <code>ls</code> takes a bunch of arguments.
A common one is <code>-l</code> which produces long (i.e., detailed) output.
</p>
<a href="ls.png" target="_blank">
<img allsky="true" title="ls output - Click for full version" alt="ls output" src="ls.png" loading="lazy">
</a>
<p>
Note that the output is in color:
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #23ad1e">Green</span> indicates the file is executable (i.e., a command).
<li><span style="color: #595ded">Blue</span> indicates the object is a directory.
<li>Black indicates the file is an "ordinary" one.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The detailed view includes the following seven columns of data:
<ol>
<li><b>Permissions</b>.
	All Linux files have an owner as well as a group the file is in.
	There are three sets of permissions:
	<ol>
	<li>The <b>owner</b> of the file.
	<li>The <b>group</b> of the file.
	<li>Everyone else, called <b>other</b>.
	</ol>
	<p>
	A typical listing of the permissions is <code>-rwxr-xr-x</code>.
	If an object is a directory, the first character is <code>d</code>,
	otherwise it's <code>-</code>.
	<br>
	Each of the three sets of permissions above have a read, write, and execute permission flag,
	for a total of 9 more characters, in groups of 3:
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>The first character of each group determines if the
		owner/group/other can <b>read</b> the file.
		<code>r</code> means the login can read the file; <code>-</code> means it can't.
		<br>For directories, read permission means the login can view the contents of a directory.
	<li>The second character determines if the owner/group/other
		can <b>write</b> the file.
		<code>w</code> means the login can write the file; <code>-</code> means it can't.
		<br>For directories, write permission means the login can add to,
		or delete from, the directory, e.g., create a file in the directory.
	<li>The third character determines if the owner/group/other
		can <b>execute</b> the file.
		<code>x</code> means the login can write the file; <code>-</code> means it can't.
		Commands must have this flag set, otherwise they can't be executed.
		<br>For directories, execute permissions mean the login can <code>cd</code> into it.
	</ol>
	In our example (<code>-rwxr-xr-x</code>), the object is a file,
	the owner can read, write, and execute it (which implies it's a command),
	anyone in the group can read and execute the command but not write, i.e., change it,
	and everyone else can also read and execute it.
<li>Number of <b>links</b> to the file.
	You can normally ignore this field.
<li>Name of the <b>owner</b> of the file.
<li>Name of the <b>group</b> the file is in.
<li><b>Size</b> in bytes of the file.
	Directories are usually a multiple of 4096.
<li><b>Date</b> the file was last modified.
<li><b>Name</b> of the file.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
In the example above that all but one object is owned by the "pi" login
and is in the "pi" group.
This is what you'd expect since the "pi" login was used to install Allsky.
Note, however, this entry:
<a href="ls-config.png" target="_blank">
<img allsky="true" title="ls output" alt="ls output for config directory" src="ls-config.png" loading="lazy">
</a>
<br>
It's in the "www-data" group, which is the group that the web server runs in.
Because the web server (which is what runs the WebUI) creates configuration files in
that directory, it also has "rwx" group permissions.
</p>
</details>

<h2>Viewing / editing files</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
The <code>cat</code> (<u>cat</u>enate) command outputs the whole contents of a file
as fast as it can.
For small files this is fine, but what if the file is larger than the size of your window?
In that case, use <code>more</code> which will display the file one page at a time.
Pressing the space bar will move to the next page.
If you only want to see the beginning or end of a file,
use <code>head</code> or <code>tail</code>.
They default to displaying 10 lines but if you want more or less add an argument such as:
<pre>
head -20 <i>some_file</i>
</pre>
to display, for example, the first 20 lines.
</p>
<p>
The most common text-file editor is <code>nano</code>.
Before using it you'll probably want to view its manual page.
</p>
<blockquote>
The Allsky configuration files should ONLY be edited via the WebUI - either
via the "Allsky Settings" page for the main "settings" file,
or via the WebUI's "Editor" page for the <span class="fileName">config.sh</span> and
<span class="fileName">ftp-settings.js</span> files,
and the Allsky Website's <span class="fileName">configuration.json</span> file.
</blockquote>
</details>

<h2>Standard in, standard out</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
By default, commands that expect input read it from the keyboard
(referred to as "standard input" or "stdin")
and write to the display ("standard output" or "stdout").
<br>
If you want the input to come from a file,
or the output to go to a file, use <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code>:
<pre>
<span class="pl-c"># This create a file called <b>/tmp/x</b> and writes "Hello World!" to it.</span>
echo "Hello World!" &gt; /tmp/x

<span class="pl-c"># This displays the contents of <b>/tmp/x</b>, which is "Hello World!".</span>
cat &lt; /tmp/x
</pre>
</p>
<blockquote>
Many commands, including <code>cat</code> also accept a filename as an argument,
and process that file, so these are functionally the same:
<pre>
cat &lt; /tmp/x
cat /tmp/x
</pre>
</details>

<h2>Shutting down the Pi</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Most operating systems, including Linux and Windows,
don't like it when you simply unplug the power to the device.
On the Pi you should instead use the
<img allsky="true" src="/documentation/img/shutdownPi.png" class="buttonIconLarge" title="Shutdown button" loading="lazy">
button on the WebUI's <span class="WebUIPage">System</span> page or via the command prompt:
<pre>
sudo shutdown -r now
</pre>
Unless you're on the console (which is very rare with an allsky camera),
you won't know when the Pi has fully shutdown so wait 30 or so seconds
before turning the power off.
</details>


<h2>Getting help</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
As stated previously, you can get information on all Linux commands via the
<code>man</code> command.
Most commands also take a <code>--help</code> option
(including the Allsky commands that are desiged to optionally be run manually):
</p>
