<p>
Your budget will often be the driving factor when picking an allsky camera.
The Raspberry Pi HQ (RPi HQ) camera is relatively inexpensive and produces good images
but can only be used with a Pi.
Many people choose ZWO cameras because they are familiar with them or they
have a spare one lying around, and they may use their allsky camera for astrophotography as well.
</p>
Some things to consider:
<ul>
<li>If you need to buy a camera and will only use it as an allsky camera,
	the RPi HQ camera is hard to beat.
<li>ZWO's ASI120MM (1280x960 resolution) is inexpensive but
	a lot of people complain about its noise and hot pixels.
	The color version is significantly less sensitive.
	We recommend staying away from this camera.
<li>The choice of mono versus color is a personal one.
	Mono cameras are usually more sensitive so require shorter exposures or less gain,
	but many people prefer color for its more "natural" look, especially during the day.
<li>Larger sensors (for example the ASI178MC @ 3096x2080) require more memory
	to produce timelapses, so you may need to follow the suggestions at
	<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/troubleshooting/timelapse.html">this page</a>.
<li>For allsky use, an extremely high resolution usually isn't needed since the lens and
	dome will cause some amount of distortion that will negate the benefits of high resolution.
<li>Newer sensors tend to produce less noise, but not always.
<li>Increasing sensor temperature will always increase noise and hot pixels,
	sometimes to the point of making the image unusable.
<li>Different cameras have different dynamic ranges
	(the difference between the brightest and darkest parts).
	Increasing a camera's gain will produce brighter, noisier images with less dynamic range.
	Consult the camera specs to learn more about the trade-off between gain and dynamic range,
	eg. <a href="https://astronomy-imaging-camera.com/product/asi482mc">ASI482MC</a>,
	<a href="https://astronomy-imaging-camera.com/product/asi290mm">ASI290MM</a>
	<a href="https://astronomy-imaging-camera.com/product/asi120mc">ASI120MC</a>,
	<a href="https://astronomy-imaging-camera.com/product/asi178mc">ASI178MC</a>.
<li>ZWO cameras usually have a 60 second auto-exposure limit.
	That may not matter much in practice since shots longer than that will usually
	produce noticeable star trailing.
<li>The "T7C" camera is an OEM version of the ASI120MC-mini.
	We <a allsky="true" href="/documentation/troubleshooting/T7cameras.html">do not recommend</a>
	it.
