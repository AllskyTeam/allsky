This page lists known issues and limitations with the current Allsky release.
Workarounds and plans to address the items, if known, are also given.
</p>
<p>
Some of items in the lists below are also in the
<a external="true" href="https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky/projects?type=classic">
list of <em>possible</em> changes to future Allsky versions</a>.
</p>

<h4>Image Capture</h4>
<ul>
	<li><span class="ki">Known Issue</span>:
		The nighttime auto-exposure, auto-gain algorithm for ZWO cameras
		can produce flickering, especially if the sky is partially cloudy.

		<br><span class="wa">Workaround</span>:
		No good one, but you can try decreasing the
		<span class="WebUISetting">Aggression</span> setting in the WebUI
		which can smooth out the brightness changes, but is slower to react to
		true brightness changes.

		<br><span class="fp">Future Plans</span>:
		Port the RPi auto-exposure and auto-gain algorithm,
		which works well, to ZWO cameras.

	<li><span class="ki">Known Issue</span>:
		Some ZWO cameras can produce <strong>ASI_ERROR_TIMEOUT</strong> messages
		and fail to take pictures.

		<br><span class="wa">Workaround</span>:
		See <a allsky="true" href="/documentation/troubleshooting/image-flicker.html">this page</a>.

		<br><span class="fp">Future Plans</span>:
		We hope that when we port he RPi auto-exposure algorithm to ZWO it will fix this.

	<li><span class="lim">Limitation</span>:
		RPi cameras don't support sensor temperature.

		<br><span class="wa">Workaround</span>: None.

		<br><span class="fp">Future Plans</span>:
		Will fix in the next release for users running the Bullseye operating system.
		<blockquote>
		The software Allsky uses to manage RPi cameras on the older Buster operating system
		is no longer being improved.
		All software updates for RPi cameras (like reading the sensor temperature)
		is happening only on Bullseye so we suggest upgrading to that operating system.
		</blockquote>

	<li><span class="lim">Limitation</span>:
		RPi cameras don't easily support dark frames.

		<br><span class="wa">Workaround</span>:
		If you are technically savy and want to use dark frames submit a new
		<a external="true" href="https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky/discussions">Discussion</a>
		asking the Allsky developers how to do it.

		<br><span class="fp">Future Plans</span>:
		Will fix in the next release for users running the Bullseye operating system.

	<li><span class="ki">Known Issue</span>:
		Multiple timelapse creations can occur simultaneously
		- usually a full timelapse and "mini" timelapse,
		or two "mini" timelapse.

		<br><span class="wa">Workaround</span>:
		Decrease the frequency of "mini" timelapse creation.

		<br><span class="fp">Future Plans</span>:
		Will only allow one timelapse creation at a time.

-->
</ul>

<h4>Overlays</h4>
<ul>
	<li><span class="ki">Known Issue</span>:
		Fonts sometimes change to <strong>Glyphicons</strong>
		This just a display problem in the Text Editor;
		the actual font used is whatever you initially specified.
		
		<br><span class="wa">Workaround</span>: None

		<br><span class="fp">Future Plans</span>: Will fix in next release.
</ul>

<h4>Modules</h4>
<ul>
	<li><span class="lim">Limitation</span>:
		Modules can only run once per flow, e.g., once per image,
		once per day/night transition, etc.

		<br><span class="wa">Workaround</span>: None

		<br><span class="fp">Future Plans</span>: Will change in next release.

	<li><span class="ki">Known Issue</span>:
		The <span class="moduleName">Overlay Module</span> may be
		disabled the first time it runs.
		This is due to the module having to download the JPL ephemeris data
		which can take some time on a slow Internet connection. 

		<br><span class="wa">Workaround</span>:
		Re-enable it in the <span class="managerName">Module Manager</span>.

		<br><span class="fp">Future Plans</span>:
		Will fix in the next release.

	<li><span class="ki">Known Issue</span>:
		The "additional modules" have been installed but they don't all appear.

		<br><span class="wa">Workaround</span>:
		Ensure the "Show Experimental" setting is enabled in the
		<span class="managerName">Module Manager's</span> settings.

		<br><span class="fp">Future Plans</span>:
		Will fix in the next release.
</ul>


<h4>Other</h4>
<ul>
	<li><span class="lim">Limitation</span>:
		Can't specify how images are sorted in the WebUI's
		<span class="WebUILink">Images</span> page
		and in the Allsky Website.

		<br><span class="wa">Workaround</span>: None

		<br><span class="fp">Future Plans</span>:
		Will add options to specify ascending (a-z) or descending (z-a) order.
</ul>
