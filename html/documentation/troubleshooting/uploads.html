<b>Uploading</b> a file means copying it to a different computer.
Allsky supports several ways to upload files including
<code>ftp</code>, <code>scp</code>, and others.
</p>

<h3>Testing an upload</h3>
<p>
After you've configured settings such as
<span class="WebUISetting">Server Name</span>
and
<span class="WebUISetting">Protocol</span>
for a remote Website or remote server,
run one of the commands below, depending on whether you are testing uploads
to a remote Allsky Website or a remote server:
<pre>
testUpload.sh --website
<span class="pl-c"> &nbsp; &nbsp; OR</span>
testUpload.sh --server
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This attempts to upload a file and if it fails,
it tries to determine why it failed and display how to fix it.
</p>
<p>
If that doesn't help, look at the sections below for additional information.
</p>

<h3>Incorrect WebUI settings or URL mapping</h3>
<p>
<blockquote>
Most people use <code>ftp</code> or <code>sftp</code> to transfer files to another machine,
so this section will assume that.
The term "remote Website" means an Allsky Website not on your Pi,
but on a remote server, possibly one you pay for services on.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
The <span class="WebUISetting">Server Name</span>,
<span class="WebUISetting">User Name</span>,
and <span class="WebUISetting">Password</span>
settings in WebUI must be correct.
If you can't log into to your remote server with that information,
Allsky won't be able to either.
Single quotes in the password can cause a problem for Allsky.
</p>
<p>
The directory structure on your remote server must match the Allsky standard;
changing locations and/or names of files and directories on the remote Website
will cause uploads to fail.
</p>
<p>
If you don't know the difference in a file location on a server and
its associated URL, check out the
<a allsky="true" external="true" href="/documentation/explanations/serverLocationToURL.html">
Mapping server locations to URLs</a> page.
</p>


<h3>Certificate-related errors</h3>
<p>
There are three main certificate-related error messages you'll see.
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Host key verification failed</b> &nbsp; OR
	<br><b>The authenticity of host 'xxxxx' can't be established</b>
	<br>
	These errors typically occur when using the <code>sftp</code> PROTOCOL.
	On the Pi, <code>ssh</code> to your remote server:
	<code>ssh -p 22 username@host</code>
	(replacing "username" and "host" with the appropriate values).
	The host will display a message and prompt for "yes" or "no".
	Enter "yes".
	This only needs to be done once for a given host.
	<br>The remote server now knows about the Pi.

<li><b>Certificate verification: certificate common name doesn't match requested host name "xyz.com"</b>
	<br>
	There are two ways to fix this:
	<ol>
	<li>Create a file called <span class="fileName">~/.lftprc</span> and add
	<code>set ssl:check-hostname false</code> to it:
		<pre>echo "set ssl:check-hostname" &gt; ~/.lftprc</pre>
	<li>Set the <span class="WebUISetting">FTP Commands</span> setting to
		<span class="WebUIValue">set ssl:check-hostname false</span>.
     	If you expect to execute <code>lftp</code> manually the first method is better,
		otherwise use the second method so all your configuration changes are in one place.
	</ol>

<li><b>Certificate verification: Not trusted</b>
	<br>
	Add <code>set ssl:verify-certificate no</code> to
	<span class="WebUISetting">FTP Commands</span> or the
	<span class="fileName">~/.lftprc</span> file as above.
</ol>
If your Pi's IP address changed, or the IP address remained but the
machine using the addressed changed, you probably need to remove the previous key from your
<span class="fileName">~/.ssh/known_hosts</span> file.
If the file has only one entry, simply remove it.
If the file has multiple entries, make a backup of the file,
then delete one entry at a time until you find the "bad" one.


<h3>Missing directories on the remote Website or server</h3>
<p>
Review the 
<a allsky="true" external="true"
href="/documentation/installations/AllskyWebsite.html">Allsky Website installation instructions</a>
or the 
<a allsky="true" external="true"
href="/documentation/installations/RemoteServer.html">Remote server installation instructions</a>
to determine how to create the necessary directories.
