This page describes how to install and upgrade Allsky.
</p>
<blockquote class="warning">
Your camera must be connected to the Pi prior to installation.
<p>
If you have an RPi camera, run the following to make sure the camera can be seen by Allsky:
<pre>
rpicam-still --list-cameras
</pre>
If camera number <code>0</code> (the first camera) is in the list, you're good to go.
<br>
Note that some non-Raspberry Pi brand cameras may need special software installed and/or operating system
configuration changes - read the camera manual.
</p>

<h2>Steps before installing Allsky</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p id="PreInstallation">
The following needs to be done prior to installing Allsky the <strong>first time</strong> on your Pi:
<ol>
	<li>If this is a new Pi, you'll need to
		<a allsky="true" href="../explanations/imageSDcard.html" external="true">
		install the Raspberry Pi Operating System (OS)</a> on it.
		We recommend installing the <strong>Desktop</strong> version of Pi OS.

	<li>Make sure your Pi has a
		<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md" external="true">working Internet connection</a>.
		Use a wired LAN connection if possible - it's faster and more reliable than a Wi-Fi connection.
		If you use
		<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#power-over-ethernet-poe-connector" external="true">
		Power over Ethernet (PoE)</a>
		you can run a single ethernet cable to your Pi.
	<li>Ensure <code>git</code> is installed:
		<pre>sudo apt-get install git</pre>
</p>
</details>


<h2>If Allsky already exists on the Pi</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
If Allsky already exists on your Pi, stop it:
<pre>
sudo systemctl stop allsky
cd
</pre>
</p>
then perform <strong>one</strong> of these steps:
<p>
<ol>
	<li>To <b>upgrade</b> the old version and keep its settings:
		<pre>mv  allsky  allsky-OLD</pre>
		During installation you will be asked if you want to use the settings from
		<code>allsky-OLD</code>.
		<br><strong>Nothing is lost with this option.</strong>
		<br><br>

	<li>To <b>archive</b> the old version but not use it:
		<br>
		<pre>mv  allsky  allsky-SAVED</pre>
		<br><strong>Nothing is lost with this option</strong>
		but after installation you'll need to re-enter all your settings
		and the new version won't have any of your prior images, timelapses, etc.
		<br>
		At some point you'll want to delete the <code>allsky-SAVED</code>
		directory to free up its disk space.
		<br><br>

	<li>To <b>delete</b> the old version -
		only select this option if you're sure you don't want any saved
		images, darks, and configuration settings:
		<pre>rm  -fr  allsky</pre>
		<br><strong>Everything is lost with this option</strong>
		so after installation you'll need to re-enter all your settings.
</ol>
</p>
</details>


<h2>Installing Allsky</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p id="Installation">
Get the Allsky software and put it in
<span class="fileName">~/allsky</span>.
Except for some system files,
all Allsky-related files reside in this directory.
</p>
<pre>
cd
git clone  --depth=1  --recursive  https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky.git</pre>
<p>
This may take a minute and should produce output similar to what's below.
The new <span class="fileName">allsky</span> directory is approximately 150 MB after download.
<pre>
Cloning into 'allsky'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 891, done.
<span class="pl-c">...  more commands here</span>
Receiving objects: 100% (891/891), 46.25 MiB | 17.82 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (100/100), done.

Cloning into '/home/pi/allsky/src/sunwait-src'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 119, done.
<span class="pl-c">...  more commands here</span>
Submodule path 'src/sunwait-src': checked out '151d8340a748a4dac7752ebcd38983b2887f5f0c'
</pre>
</p>

<br>
<p>
Now install Allsky:
<pre>
cd allsky
./install.sh</pre>
<p>
The installation may prompt for several items
(<strong>accepting the defaults is recommended</strong>).
Upgrades produce fewer prompts.
<ul>
	<li>If the <strong>host name</strong> has never been changed you
		are asked to enter a new name - the default is <code>allsky</code>.
		If you have more than one Pi on the same network they
		<strong>must</strong> all have unique names.
		For example, if you have a test Pi you may want to call it <code>allsky-test</code>.
	<li>The <strong>Locale</strong> to use.
		This determines what the decimal separator is in log output
		(period or comma).
		<br>Note that the default locale is <code>en_GB.UTF-8</code> where the Pi is developed.
	<li>Adding <strong>swap space</strong> if needed.
		This effectively increases the amount of memory your Pi has.
		Insufficient swap space is one of the leading causes of timelapse video creations problems.
	<li>Putting the <span class="fileName">~/allsky/tmp</span>
		directory in memory instead of on the disk.
		This directory holds temporary Allsky files and is where most Allsky files are
		initially written to.
		Putting the directory in memory <b>significantly</b> reduces the number of writes
		to the SD card, which increases its life.
	<li>New installations will prompt for the <strong>Latitude</strong> and <strong>Longitude</strong> to use.
		In most cases values based on your network's location will be displayed as defaults.
	<li>If a <strong>reboot</strong> is needed you are asked if the Pi should be
		rebooted when installation completes.
		If you answer "no", note that Allsky will not start until the Pi is rebooted.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The installation will notify you of any actions you need
to take when the installation completes.
If there are any such actions, the WebUI will display a message reminding you of those actions.
Clear the message(s) when done performing the actions.
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
The installation <i>may</i> take up to an hour, depending on how many package
you already have installed and the speed of your Pi.
Subsequent installations of Allsky will be significantly faster.
</blockquote>
</p>
</details>


<h2>After installation completes</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
After installation, reboot if told to,
then perform any actions the identified during installation.
Allsky will not begin until you do the following:
<ol>
	<li>Bring up the WebUI by entering
		<code>http://allsky.local</code> or
		<code>http://allsky.localhost</code> in a web browser.
		The default username is <strong>admin</strong> and the default password is <strong>secret</strong>.
		<blockquote>
		If your Pi is accessible via the Internet, change the username and password via the
		<span class="WebUILink">Change Password</span> link on the WebUI.
		</blockquote>

	<li>Go to the <span class="WebUILink">Allsky Settings</span> page.
	<li>If there's a message saying you need to configure Allsky or
		review the settings, do that now.
	<li>Click on the blue button.
		It may look like
		<span class="btn btn-primary btn-not-real btn-small">Save changes</span>,
		or
		<span class="btn btn-primary btn-not-real btn-small">Configuration done; start Allsky</span>,
		or something similar.
		<br>
		Allsky will start.
</ol>
</details>


<h2>Starting and stopping Allsky</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Allsky starts automatically when the Raspberry Pi boots up.
To enable or disable this behavior, run:
<pre>
sudo systemctl enable allsky     <span class="shellComment"># starts Allsky when the Pi boots up</span>
<span class="shellComment">#   OR</span>
sudo systemctl disable allsky    <span class="shellComment"># does NOT automatically start Allsky</span>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
When you want to manually start, stop, or restart Allsky,
or obtain status, use <strong>one</strong> of these commands:
<pre>
sudo systemctl start allsky
sudo systemctl stop allsky
sudo systemctl restart allsky    <span class="shellComment"># a restart is the same as a stop then start</span>
sudo systemctl status allsky
</pre>
</p>
<p class="morePadding">
<blockquote>
Tip: Add lines like the following to <span class="fileName">~/.bashrc</span> to save typing:
<pre>
alias start='sudo systemctl start allsky'
</pre>
You then only need to type <code>start</code> to start Allsky.
Do this for the other commands as well.
</blockquote>
</p>

<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
<p>
Starting Allsky from the terminal is a great way to track down issues as
it provides debug information to the terminal window.
To start Allsky manually, run:
<pre>
sudo systemctl stop allsky
cd ~/allsky
./allsky.sh
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If you are using a desktop environment (Pixel, Mate, LXDE, etc.) or using remote desktop or VNC,
you can add the <code>--preview</code> argument to show the images the program is
currently saving in a separate window:
<pre>
./allsky.sh --preview
</pre>
</p>
