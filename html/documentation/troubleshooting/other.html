<h2>RPi HD camera stops taking pictures</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
This issue is normally resolved by upgrading the firmware on your Pi by doing the following:  
<pre>
sudo apt update 
sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo shutdown -r now
</pre>

</details>


<h2>USB reset messages in system logs</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
You can ignore entries similar to the following in the system logs:  
<pre>
Sep 15 17:44:28 Pi-Allsky kernel: [108641.695297] usb 1-1.5: reset
	high-speed USB device number 4 using dwc_otg
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The ZWO software adds these whenever video mode is turned on,
which is either once every time you start the AllSky Software,
or every time and image is taken, depending on your settings.
</p>

</details>


<h2>Can't save image because one is already being saved</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
This message appears in <span class="fileName">/var/log/allsky.log</span>
when the time to save and process an image is greater than the time to take an
image plus the delay between images.
For example, if it takes 10 seconds to save and process an image but your exposure time is
1 second and your delay between exposures is 2 seconds (for a total of 3 seconds),
the software will try to save the second picture while the first one is still being saved.
</p>
<p>
<span class="fileName">png</span> files can take 10 or more seconds to save on a
Pi 4 because there is no hardware support for them.
You may also see this message if the delay between images is too short, e.g., less than a second.
</p>
<p>
There also may be messages like these in <span class="fileName">/var/log/lighttpd/error.log</span>:
<pre>
2021-10-19 15:17:10: (chunk.c.831) file shrunk: /home/pi/allsky/tmp/image.jpg
2021-10-19 15:17:10 (connections.c.456) connection closed: write failed on fd 8
</pre>
This means that a file shrunk in size while the web server was reading it.
With these errors you'll usually see bands of pixels in the images.
</p>
<p>
To fix this:
<ul>
<li>Increase your delay or save to
<span class="fileName">jpg</span> format instead of <span class="fileName">png</span>.
<li>If you have an extremely slow SD card try replacing it with a faster one.
	Or, make the <span class="fileName">allsky/tmp</span> directory a memory-filesystem.
	See the
	<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/miscellaneous/tips.html">Reducing wear on your SDcard</a>
	tip.
</ul>
</details>


<h2>Images are too light or too dark</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Depending on what camera you have,
you can try adjusting the <span class="WebUISetting">Gain</span>,
<span class="WebUISetting">Brightness</span>,
<span class="WebUISetting">Exposure</span>,
and <span class="WebUISetting">Bin</span>.
There are separate exposure-related settings for daytime and nighttime,
so make sure you pick the right ones.
During the day you'll normally use
<span class="WebUISetting">Bin</span> of <span class="WebUIValue">1x1</span>
(i.e., binning off), and
<span class="WebUISetting">Gain</span> of <span class="WebUIValue">0</span>
since images are bright enough that you don't need those settings.
If your images are too dark using auto exposure and the exposure length doesn't increase,
it may be hitting the maximum exposure limit.
You can set it on the WebUI <span class="WebUIWebPage">Allsky Settings</span>
page but note that ZWO cameras usually have a maximum auto exposure length of 60 seconds.
</p>
</details>


<h2>Images are corrupted</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Various forms of image corruption have been observed:
the right side of the image is full of repeating pixels,
image contains parts of two or more frames, offset lines, etc.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Check your power supply and cooling.
	The Pi will report on undervoltage and/or throttled status on the
	<span class="WebUIWebPage">System</span> page of the WebUI.
	If it doesn't say <b>No throttling</b> in green you should investigate and remediate.
<li>If you have a ZWO camera it may be experiencing some internal firmware error;
	reset the camera either by unplugging it or,
	if you have the <code>uhubctl</code> command installed,
	power cycling the port with
	<pre>sudo uhubctl -a 2 $(grep -l 03c3 /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idVendor | \
		cut -d / -f 6 | sed -Ee 's/(.*)[.]([0-9]+)$/-l \1 -p \2/')</pre>
</ul>
