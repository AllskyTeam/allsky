This page describes how to prepare a remote server
to accept uploads of the current Allsky image
as well as startrails, keograms, and timelapse videos.
</p>

<blockquote class="warning">
This page is for setting up a <strong>remote server</strong>,
which typically does not run an Allsky Website.
If you want to set up a <strong>remote Website</strong>,
click <a allsky="true" href="Allsky.html">here</a>.
</blockquote>

<h4>Why use a remote server?</h4>
<p>
Since this server does NOT run the Allsky Website software you may wonder
why have a remote server.
Let's say you have a web page for an observatory that has a description of
your equipment as well as some astrophotographs you've taken.
If you also want to include the current allsky image as well as last night's timelapse,
you'd simply set up your observatory web server to accept pictures from Allsky,
then update Allsky to upload the pictures.
</p>

<h4>Preparing the remote server</h4>
<p>
The exact commands you use will depend on your server and/or hosting solution,
but at a high level the steps are:
<ol>
	<li>Create the following directories on the server,
		making sure their names are lowercase and spelled exactly as below:
		<ul class="minimalpadding">
			<li><span class="fileName">allsky</span>
			<li><span class="fileName">allsky/videos</span>
			<li><span class="fileName">allsky/videos/thumbnails</span>
			<li><span class="fileName">allsky/startrails</span>
			<li><span class="fileName">allsky/startrails/thumbnails</span>
			<li><span class="fileName">allsky/keograms</span>
			<li><span class="fileName">allsky/keograms/thumbnails</span>
		</ul>
	<li>Go to the <span class="subSettingsHeader">Remote Server Settings</span> section
		of the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Allsky Settings</span> page
		and fill in the settings.
		See the
		<a allsky="true" external="true" href="../settings/allsky.html#remoteserver">
		Allsky Settings</a> page for a description of the settings.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
After enabling the <span class="WebUISetting">Use Remote Server</span> setting
a test file will be uploaded to the server to ensure it works.
If there are any problems, visit the
<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/troubleshooting/uploads.html">
Troubleshooting -&gt; Uploads</a> page for details on how to fix the problem.
