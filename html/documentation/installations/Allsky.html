<p>
This page describes how to install and upgrade Allsky.
</p>
<p>
After Allsky is running and you've configured it to your satisfaction,
you may want to install the Allsky Website on your Pi and/or on a remote server.
See the <a allsky="true" href="AllskyWebsite.html">Allsky Website Installation</a> page for details.
</p>
<blockquote>
This release of Allsky has many updates so we suggest
you <b>install the newest <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">Raspberry Pi OS</a>
(Bullseye) on your Pi</b>,
before installing this release of Allsky.
You'll first need to save any files, images, etc. to a USB drive, PC, Mac, or another device,
then install the new Pi operating system (OS), and then restore your files before installing Allsky.
During installation of the new Pi OS, if asked for the name of a user account to create,
enter <code>pi</code>.
<br>
The process is much simplier if you have a spare SD card you can install the new
Pi OS version on, and have an SD card-to-USB adapter so you can plug the old SD card into
the Pi after the new OS is installed.
Copying your old files is then a breeze.
</blockquote>

<h2>Install AllSky in a different location (advanced)</h2>
<details><summary></summary>

<blockquote>
Only advanced users should consider installing Allsky in a different location.
All the documentation assumes it's installed in the default location,
so it may be more difficult to troubleshoot if it's elsewhere.
</blockquote>
<p>
By default, Allsky is installed as the login "pi" in <span class="fileName">/home/pi/allsky</span>.
The name <span class="fileName">allsky</span> can not be changed,
but you can install Allsky in a different directory
(which usually means it'll run as a different login).
For example, to install in <span class="fileName">/home/mylogin</span>
and run as the "mylogin" user, do the following before installing Allsky:
<pre>
sudo mkdir /home/mylogin      <span class="pl-c"># if not already there</span>
sudo addgroup mylogin sudo    <span class="pl-c"># allows Allsky to execute system commands</span>
cd /home/mylogin
</pre>
After the above, continue with the steps below.
</details>


<h2>If a version of Allsky already exists</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
If you have an <b>existing</b> version of Allsky,
stop it
<pre>
sudo systemctl stop allsky
cd
</pre>

then perform one of the steps below:
</p>
<ol class="minimalPadding">
	<li>To <b>upgrade</b> the old version:
	<pre>mv allsky allsky-OLD         <span class="pl-c"># The installation looks for this directory</span></pre>

	<li>To <b>save</b> the old version but not use it:
	<br>
	<pre>mv allsky allsky-SAVED</pre>
	At some point you'll want to delete the SAVED version so it doesn't take disk space.

	<li>To <b>delete</b> the old version.
		Only select this option if you're sure you don't want any saved
		images, darks, and configuration settings.
	Either way, execute:
	<pre>rm -fr allsky</pre>
</ol>
<p>
Continue to the <a href="#PreInstallation">Pre installation</a> section.
</p>
</details>


<h2 id=PreInstallation>Pre installation</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Prior to installing Allsky, there are a few things you need to do.
These only need to be done once.
<ol>
	<li>If this is a new Pi, you'll need to install the Raspberry Pi Operating System (OS) on it.
		Follow
		<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/">these instructions</a>
		for information on how to do it.  Be sure to install the newest OS.
	<li>Make sure your Pi has a
		<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md">working Internet connection</a>.
		If you have a choice between a wired LAN and wireless WLAN connection,
		choose the wired connect - they are faster and more reliable.
		If you use Power over Ethernet (PoE), you can run a single cable to your Pi.
	<li>Install <code>git</code> if not already installed (you only need to do this once):
		<pre>sudo apt-get install git</pre>
</p>
</details>


<h2 id="Installation">Installation</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<blockquote>
Unlike prior versions of AllSky this version requires that the camera be
connected prior to starting the installation process.
During installation, the camera model will be automatically determined
and the appropriate minimum, maximum, and default settings populated in the WebUI.
</blockquote>
<p>
The following commands will put the new release of Allsky in <span class="fileName">~/allsky</span>.
Except for some system files, all Allsky and Allsky Website-related files reside in this directory.
</p>

<pre>
cd
git clone --recursive https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky.git
cd allsky
./install.sh</pre>
<p>
The <code>git clone</code> will take a couple minutes and should produce output similar to
what's below.
The new <span class="fileName">allsky</span> directory is approximately 150 MB after download.
<pre>

</pre>
<p>
The installation prompts for several items that allow it to configure the Pi so
Allsky runs most efficiently given your Pi's configuration.
These prompts include:
<ul>
	<li>New host name, if not the default of <b>allsky</b>.
		If you have more than one Pi on the same network they must all have unique names.
		For example, if you have a test Pi you may want to call it <span class="fileName">allsky-test</span>.
	<li>Adding swap space if needed.
		Swap space effectively increases the amount of memory your Pi has.
		Insufficient swap space is one of the leading causes of timelapse video creations problems.
	<li>Putting the <span class="fileName">~/allsky/tmp</span> directory in memory instead of on the disk.
		This directory holds temporary Allsky files and is where most Allsky files are written to.
		Putting the directory in memory <b>significantly</b> reduces the number of writes
		to the SD card, which increases its life.
</ul>
It's highly recommended to accept the defaults.
</p>
<p>
During installation you'll be notified of any actions you need
to take when the installation completes.
If there are any such actions, the first time Allsky runs after the reboot it will stop and:
<ul>
	<li>add those actions to the log file
	<li>display an image telling you to see the log file
	<li>display a message in the WebUI (which you should clear when done performing the actions)
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
Parts of the installation take up to an hour, depending on how many package
you already have installed and the speed of your Pi.
Subsequent installations of Allsky will be significantly faster.
</blockquote>
</p>
</details>


<h2>Post installation</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
After installation, reboot if told to,
then perform any actions the installation script identified.
</p>
<blockquote>
If instructed to copy the contents of a prior configuration file to the new release,
it's important to manually copy the <b>values</b>
from the old file to the new file and <b>not</b> copy the entire file.
</blockquote>

After the reboot, do the following:
<ol>
	<li>Bring up the WebUI by entering
		<code>http://allsky.local</code> or
		<code>http://allsky.localhost</code> in a web browser.
		The default username is <strong>admin</strong> and the default password is <strong>secret</strong>.
		<blockquote>
		If your website is publically viewable you should change the username and password via the
		<span class="WebUILink">Change Password</span> link on the WebUI.
		</blockquote>

	<li>Go to the <span class="WebUILink">Allsky Settings</span> page.
	<li>Make any necessary changes.
	<li>Click on the
		<span class="btn btn-primary btn-not-real btn-small">Save changes</span> button.
		Allsky will (re)start.
</ol>
</details>


<h2>Starting and stopping Allsky</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
AllSky starts automatically when the Raspberry Pi boots up.
To enable or disable this behavior, use these commands:
<pre>
sudo systemctl enable allsky     <span class="shellComment"># starts the software when the Pi boots up</span>
sudo systemctl disable allsky    <span class="shellComment"># does NOT automatically start the software</span>
</pre>

When you want to manually start, stop, or restart the software, or obtain status, use one of these commands:
<pre>
sudo systemctl start allsky
sudo systemctl stop allsky
sudo systemctl restart allsky
sudo systemctl status allsky
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
Tip: Add lines like the following to <span class="fileName">~/.bashrc</span> to save typing:
<pre>
alias start='sudo systemctl start allsky'
</pre>
You will then only need to type <code>start</code> to start Allsky.
Do this for <b>stop</b> and <b>restart</b> as well.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Starting the program from the terminal is a great way to track down issues as
it provides debug information to the terminal window.
To start the program manually, run:
<pre>
sudo systemctl stop allsky
cd ~/allsky
./allsky.sh
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If you are using a desktop environment (Pixel, Mate, LXDE, etc.) or using remote desktop or VNC,
you can add the <code>preview</code> argument to show the images the program is
currently saving in a separate window.
<pre>
./allsky.sh preview
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
The <b>Allsky Website</b> normally does not need to be started or stopped,
but if you need to do so run <code>systemctl start lighttpd</code>.
</blockquote>
