The [Allsky Map](https://www.thomasjacquin.com/allsky-map/){ target="_blank" rel="noopener" .external }  shows the location and basic information of all known allsky cameras. Clicking on a pin displays information about the camera and if the owner has set their image URL, you'll see their last image as well; clicking on the image takes you to their Allsky website.

## Adding your camera
To add your camera to the map, enable the Show On Map setting in the Allsky Map Settings section of the WebUI. If your camera is already on the map you can remove it by turning the setting off. You can also update your information by changing any of the map-related settings.

Once you've enabled Show On Map, your map information will be automatically sent to the map server whenever you change it, as well as every other day so it can distinguish current data from old, expired data.

All these changes take effect immediately - no human intervention required!

See the Allsky Settings   documentation page for a description of the map-related settings.

**My Website isn't available on the Internet**

You can still have a pin of your camera's location appear on the map - just leave the Website URL and Image URL fields blank in the WebUI.
