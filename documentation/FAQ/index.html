<h2>The <code>/var/log/allsky.log</code> file is gone?  How do I get it back?</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Try restarting the software: <code>sudo systemctl restart allsky</code>.
<li>If that doesn't help, restart the software that controls the log files: <code>sudo systemctl restart syslog</code>.
<li>If that doesn't help, reboot the Pi.
<li>If that doesn't help, wait until tomorrow - sometimes the log file mysteriously reappears after midnight.
Note this is NOT an Allsky problem since it also happens with other services.
</ul>
</p>

<h2>After starting Allsky, all I get is "Allsky software is starting up"</h2>
<p>
Most likely Allsky is dropping all images for being overly dark or overly bright due to inappropriate settings.
Check the log to see what it says by running <code>tail -f /var/log/allsky.log</code> in a terminal window.
</p>
<p>
If you are using <b>manual</b> exposure/gain try adjusting those values.
</p>
<p>
If you are using <b>auto</b> exposure/gain, the starting values are what you specified as the manual values,
and it may take several exposures for the software to home in on the best exposure.
While it's doing that, you'll see the "Allsky software is starting up" message.  This is normal.
If, however the message remains after several minutes follow the instructions
<a href="https://github.com/thomasjacquin/allsky/wiki/Reporting-Issues">here</a> and submit the log file.
</p>
<p>
You can also temporarily set <code>REMOVE_BAD_IMAGES="false"</code> in ~/allsky/config/config.sh
to see what the incorrectly exposed images look like - this might give you an idea as to the problem.
