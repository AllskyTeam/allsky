If you have a remote Allsky Website or a remote Server,
the <span class="WebUISetting">Server Name</span>,
<span class="WebUISetting">URL</span>,
and <span class="WebUISetting">Image Directory</span>
settings in the WebUI can be very confusing.
<p>
<strong>Read this page carefully</strong>.
<p>
It may take 5 or 10 minutes,
but it's important that you understand <strong>what</strong>
you are doing and <strong>why</strong>
so that you can fix any future problems quickly.
</p>

<p>
At a high level, a website is a collection of files
sitting in a directory on some computer's disk drive.
If a company called <span class="cars">Classic Cars</span> has a website at
<code>https://classiccars.com</code>,
the directory on its computer that contains that website
might be called <span class="fileName">cars</span>.
It may have sub-directories containing related files like
<span class="fileName">wheels</span> and
<span class="fileName">seats</span>.
</p>

<p>
If you want to get information on red wheels you enter
<code>https://classiccars.com/wheels/red.pdf</code> into your browser,
and software called the "web server" on the <code>classiccars.com</code> computer
starts in the <span class="fileName">cars</span> directory,
then goes to the <span class="fileName">wheels</span> directory,
then gets the <span class="fileName">red.pdf</span> file
and sends it to your browser.
The web server mapped the
<code>https://classiccars.com/wheels/red.pdf</code> URL to the
<span class="fileName">cars/wheels/red.info</span> file on the server.
</p>

<p>
Likewise,
when you go to the Allsky WebUI, for example via <code>http://allsky</code>,
your Pi's web server looks in <span class="fileName">~/allsky/html</span>
since that's what the Allsky developers specified as the root of the WebUI.
</p>

<p>
We now know there are TWO paths to a file in a website:
<ol class="minimalPadding">
	<li>a URL used in a browser
	<li>a file path name used when logged into the server
</ol>
As a user, you only care about the first path.
If you work for <span class="cars">Classic Cars</span> and need to update the
<span class="fileName">red.pdf</span> file, you only care about the second path.
</p>
<p>
Allsky needs to know about BOTH paths to files on your remote Website.
Sometimes mapping a URL to file location on a server is easy,
and other times it's more difficult.
</p>


<h3>1. Easy case: server directory structure matches URL</h3>
<p>
<blockquote>
If you are having a problem with your remote Website settings,
this case probably doesn't apply to you unless you know almost nothing about computers.
Read it anyhow because it will give you a better understanding of the problem.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
You want to create a remote Allsky Website so you purchase a plan with a hosting provider
for a website with a URL of <code>https://mysite.com</code>.
The provider gives you a login on their server and tells you the:
<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li><span class="WebUISetting">Server Name</span>
	<li><span class="WebUISetting">User Name</span>
	<li><span class="WebUISetting">Password</span>
</ul>
so you enter those into the WebUI.
The provider also tells you that whatever you upload to the
server will be visible via the URL using the same name.
You use an FTP program like
<a external="true" href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>
to log into the server and create a directory called <span class="fileName">allsky</span>
for the remote Website.
(Visit the <a allsky="true" external="true"
	href="/documentation/installations/AllskyWebsite.html">
	Allsky Website Installation</a> for the rest of the steps for creating a remote Website).
</p>
<p>
In the WebUI you set the Remote Website's
<span class="WebUISetting">Website URL</span>
to <code>https://mysite.com/allsky</code>
and <span class="WebUISetting">Image Directory</span>
to <span class="WebUIValue">/allsky</span>
(or <span class="WebUIValue">allsky</span>, depending on your service provider).
</p>


<h3>2. More difficult case: directory structure does NOT match URL</h3>
<p>
You have the same website URL as above,
but when you log into the server you
see a directory called <span class="fileName">public_html</span>.
The hosting provider tells you that you need to put file into that directory
in order to see them via the <code>https://mysite.com</code> URL.
</p>
<p>
In this case the web server is mapping the <code>https://mysite.com</code> URL to
the <span class="fileName">/public_html</span> directory on the server.
You need to create a <span class="fileName">/public_html/allsky</span>
directory on the server and install the Allsky Website there.
The URL to the Allsky Website is still <code>https://mysite.com/allsky</code>
but in the WebUI you'd set the Remote Server's
<span class="WebUISetting">Image Directory</span>
to <span class="WebUIValue">/public_html/allsky</span>
(or <span class="WebUIValue">public_html/allsky</span> depending on your service provider).
</p>
<p>
Mapping URLs to server directories like this is fairly common on remote servers that
are shared by many people.
</p>

<h3>3. Hardest case: you are totally lost</h3>
<p>
If the hosting provider didn't tell you where to put your files on their server,
you'll need to figure it out.
When you log into the server you see
a directory called <span class="fileName">users</span>
and inside it is a directory called <span class="fileName">your_login_name</span>.
Inside that directory is a <span class="fileName">public_html</span> directory.
</p>
<p>
You first try creating the
<span class="fileName">allsky</span> directory in
<span class="fileName">users</span> but it gives you an
"<strong>Access Denied</strong>" message.
</p>
<p>
You then try creating the <span class="fileName">allsky</span> directory in
<span class="fileName">users/your_login_name</span>
and it works, so in the WebUI you set the remote Website's
<span class="WebUISetting">Image&nbsp;Directory</span>
to <span class="WebUIValue">users/your_login_name/allsky</span>.
After
<a allsky="true" external="true" href="/documentation/installations/AllskyWebsite.html">
	installing the remote Allsky Website</a>
you go to <code>https://mysite.com/allsky</code> in your browser
but get a "<strong>404 - Not Found</strong>" message.
<br>
Frustrated, you create an <span class="fileName">allsky</span> directory in the
<span class="WebUIValue">users/your_login_name/public_html</span>
directory on the server.
It's late so you go to bed.
</p>
<p>
The next day you go to <code>https://mysite.com/allsky</code> and see your Website,
but notice the startrails, keogram, and timelapse files aren't there.
</p>
<p>
To help determine what's happening you run the following on your Pi:
<pre>allsky-config  compare_paths  --website</pre>
</p>
<p>
This command tries to determine both paths to the
<span class="fileName">allsky</span> directory -
the location on the server where the <code>https://mysite.com/allsky</code> points to,
and the location of the directory on the server when you log into it.
<br>
It returns:
<pre>
UPLOAD directory = /users
WEB    directory = C:\www\users\your_login_name\public_html\allsky
A list of files on the UPLOAD site is in '/home/pi/allsky/tmp/comparePaths.sh-WEBSITE/upload-ls.txt'.
A list of files on the WEB server is in '/home/pi/allsky/tmp/comparePaths.sh-WEBSITE/web-ls.txt'.
</pre>
</p>
<p class="morePadding">
The <code>UPLOAD</code> directory is what you see when you log into the server.
The <code>WEB</code> directory is where the <span class="fileName">allsky</span>
directory is on the server when you log into it, i.e.,
it's the directory on the server that the <code>https://mysite.com/allsky</code> URL maps to.
</p>

<p>
You notice that both directories have <code>users</code> in them
so you (correctly) determine the <code>/users</code> UPLOAD directory
is the same as the <code>C:\www\users</code> directory on the server.
That means the files that are being displayed in a browser are in
<span class="fileName">users/your_login_name/public_html/allsky</span>
on the server.
<br>
Allsky uploads files to the location specified in the
<span class="WebUISetting">Image Directory</span> setting,
which is still <span class="WebUIValue">users/your_login_name/allsky</span>.
You look at that directory on the server and see the
startrails, keogram, and timelapse files.
</p>
<p>
You fix the problem by changing 
<span class="WebUISetting">Image Directory</span> to
<span class="WebUIValue">users/your_login_name/public_html/allsky</span>
and deleting the <span class="WebUIValue">users/your_login_name/allsky</span> directory
on the server since it's not used.
You then run <code>generateForDay.sh --upload</code> on the Pi
to have Allsky upload the startrails, keogram, and timelapse files
from last night to the correct place.
