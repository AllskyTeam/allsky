<h2>Reducing wear on your SDcard</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
SDcards have a limited number of writes they can handle before they wear out.
Although this is usually a very large number you may wish nonetheless to
minimize writes to the SDcard.
The bet way to do this is by making Allsky's <span class="fileName">allsky/tmp</span>
directory a memory-based filesystem,
i.e., instead of residing on the SDcard it resides in RAM memory.

<blockquote>
During Allsky installation you were prompted to create
<span class="fileName">tmp</span> as a memory-based filesystem.
If you did that you can ignore this tip.
</blockquote>

Note the following:
<ul>
<li>In order to do this you'll need enough free RAM memory,
	so this may not work well with systems with very limited memory, for example, 512 MB.
<li>The contents of the <span class="fileName">tmp</span>
	directory will be erased every time you reboot your Pi.
	This should be ok since it's only used for temporary log files and to hold images
	as they come out of the camera,
	before they are stored in <span class="fileName">allsky/images/DATE</span>.
</ul>
<p>
It's simple to create a memory-based filesystem:
<pre>
cd ~/allsky
./install.sh --function check_tmp
</pre>

It's suggested you accept the defaults.

<h2>Focusing the camera</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Try get your camera at least roughly focused during the day.
It'll be easier to see your focus ring, and exposure duration will be much shorter so
you'll get more instant feedback.
</p>
<p>
To complete focus, enable the <span class="WebUISetting">Show Focus Metric</span>
setting in the WebUI's <b>Allsky Settings</b> page.
A focus number will appear on your images - the higher the number, the better focus you have.
Note that the number can change depending on the brightness,
so focus when the brightness isn't changing.
<p>
When done focusing, disable the <span class="WebUISetting">Show Focus Metric</span>
setting since it's no longer needed.
</p>

<h2>Pro-tip: install <code>gh</code> on your Pi so you can easily collaborate using Github Gists</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Click <a href="https://cli.github.com/">here</a>
for the full details or download the latest release from
<a href="https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/latest">here</a>.
Once you have the Command Line Interface (CLI) installed,
you can easily upload a script you wrote with something like:
<pre>
gh gist create -d "a tool to find alien spaceships" < my_awesome_allsky_script.py
</pre>

or share logs using something like
<pre>
journalctl --since 05:00 -u allsky | gh gist create
gh gist create < log.txt
</pre>
