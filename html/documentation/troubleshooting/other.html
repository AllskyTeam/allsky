<h2>USB reset messages in system logs</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
You can ignore entries similar to the following in the system logs:  
<pre>
Sep 15 17:44:28 Pi-Allsky kernel: [108641.695297] usb 1-1.5: reset
	high-speed USB device number 4 using dwc_otg
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The ZWO software adds these whenever video mode is turned on,
which is either once every time you start the AllSky Software,
or every time and image is taken, depending on your settings.
</p>

</details>


<h2>Can't save image because one is already being saved</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
This message appears in <span class="fileName">/var/log/allsky.log</span>
when the time to save and process an image is greater than the time to take an
image plus the delay between images.
For example, if it takes 10 seconds to save and process an image but your exposure time is
1 second and your delay between exposures is 2 seconds (for a total of 3 seconds),
the software will try to save the second picture while the first one is still being saved.
</p>
<p>
<span class="fileName">png</span> files can take 10 or more seconds to save on a
Pi 4 because there is no hardware support for them.
You may also see this message if the delay between images is too short, e.g., less than a second.
</p>
<p>
There also may be messages like these in <span class="fileName">/var/log/lighttpd/error.log</span>:
<pre>
2021-10-19 15:17:10: (chunk.c.831) file shrunk: /home/pi/allsky/tmp/image.jpg
2021-10-19 15:17:10 (connections.c.456) connection closed: write failed on fd 8
</pre>
This means that a file shrunk in size while the web server was reading it.
With these errors you'll usually see bands of pixels in the images.
</p>
<p>
To fix this:
<ul class="minimalPadding">
<li>Increase your delay or save to
<span class="fileName">jpg</span> format instead of <span class="fileName">png</span>.
<li>If you have an extremely slow SD card try replacing it with a faster one.
	Or, make the <span class="fileName">allsky/tmp</span> directory a memory-filesystem
	if not already done during installation.
	See the
	<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/miscellaneous/FAQ.html">Reducing wear on your SDcard</a>
	tip.
</ul>

<h2>Images are too light, too dark, or stars are hard to see</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<h3>Overall image too light or too dark</h3>
<p>
If your images are too light or too dark and you are using <b>manual exposure</b>
try adjusting the <span class="WebUISetting">Gain</span>,
<span class="WebUISetting">Exposure</span>,
and/or <span class="WebUISetting">Bin</span>.
There are separate exposure-related settings for daytime and nighttime,
so make sure you pick the right ones.
During the day you'll normally use
<span class="WebUISetting">Bin</span> of <span class="WebUIValue">1x1</span>
(i.e., binning off), and
<span class="WebUISetting">Gain</span> of <span class="WebUIValue">0</span>
since images are bright enough that you don't need those settings.
</p>
<p>
If you are using <b>auto exposure</b> change the 
<span class="WebUISetting">Mean Target</span> to change the overall brightness of the image.
It will vary the gain and exposure up to the maximum values you specify.
If your images are still too dark overall try increasing the maximum values.
Note that every camera has a maximum gain and exposure it supports - hover your cursor
over those values to see what the maximums are.
</p>
<h3>Stars hard to see</h3>
If the stars are too hard to see but the overall image image brightness is where you want it,
try
<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/explanations/exposureGainSaturation.html#stretch">stretching</a>
the image which changes the contrast.
</details>

<h2>Images are corrupted</h2>
<details><summary></summary>
<p>
Various forms of image corruption have been observed:
the right side of the image is full of repeating pixels,
image contains parts of two or more frames, offset lines, etc.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Check your power supply and cooling.
	The Pi will report on undervoltage and/or throttled status on the
	<span class="WebUIWebPage">System</span> page of the WebUI.
	If it doesn't say <b class="progress-bar-success">No throttling</b>
	you should investigate and remediate.
<li>If you have a ZWO camera it may be experiencing some internal firmware error;
	reset the camera either by unplugging it or,
	if you have the <code>uhubctl</code> command installed,
	power cycling the port with
	<pre>sudo uhubctl -a 2 $(grep -l 03c3 /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idVendor | \
		cut -d / -f 6 | sed -Ee 's/(.*)[.]([0-9]+)$/-l \1 -p \2/')</pre>
</ul>
