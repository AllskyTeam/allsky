                    <h2>What are modules?</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>Modules provide functionality that can be used to enhance the images created by AllSky,
                            modules can also provide functionality that does not affect the images but more on that
                            later. The Module Manager allows you to control which modules are run and when they are run.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are two types of modules</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>System Modules</strong> - These are developed and maintained by the AllSky team.
                                These modules are installed with the main AllSky installer</li>
                            <li><strong>User Modules</strong> - These are developed and maintained by people outside of
                                the AllSky development team. These modules are installed via a separate installer, See
                                LINK. These modules can be deleted if no longer required</li>
                        </ul>

                        <blockquote>
                            <strong>User Modules</strong> User modules must only be installed from the official AllSky
                            repositories. Installing modules from other source could be dangerous and is not encouraged.
                        </blockquote>

                        <blockquote>
                            <strong>Experimental Modules</strong> When installed some modules will display a warning
                            that they are experimental. Before using any of these modules you should ensure that you are
                            proficient in analysing Linux Logs files. They should be considered unstable and as such may
                            'break' your AllSky installation. In the Module Manager settings you can enable/disable
                            experimental modules
                        </blockquote>

                        <blockquote>
                            <strong>Hardware Dependent Modules</strong> Some modules are designed to operate with
                            external hardware, typically connected to the Pi's GPIO pins. Before attempting to use any
                            of these modules you should ensure you have an understanding of interfacing hardware to the
                            PI's GPIO
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>Please don't be discouraged by the above warnings. The module system provides a very flexible
                            system allowing you to customise the AllSky software to your requirements without having to
                            change any code</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Module Flows</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>To enabled modules to make changes they are run within 'Flows'. For each of the Flows you can
                            define which modules run and the order in which they are run.</p>

                                    <li>Uncheck the enable checkbox - This will disable the module but retain any
                                        settings. This is the preferred method if you just wish to temporarily disable a

                                        <p>A typical connection diagram for a Cloud Cover sensor. As mentioned above the
                                            process of detecting clouds is not a simple one. The basic principle is to
                                            measure the difference between the ambient temperature and the temperature
                                            of the sky. The ambient is fairly easy to measure but the sky temperature
                                            presenets a few problems</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Field of View (FOV) - A narrow FOV will lead to results just above the
                                                sensor whereas a wide FOV will have less sensitivity. Testing has found
                                                that the narrow FOV versions provide a more accurate reading albeit with
                                                the much narrower FOV</li>
                                            <li>Moisture - Since the sensor needs to be pointed vertically if any
                                                moisture from rain/snow sits on it then the reading will be inaccurate
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>The moisture problem is a little more difficult to solve and the best
                                            solution found is to mount the sensor horizontally and use a reflective
                                            surface to reflect the sky onto the sensor. This will allos the sensor to
                                            stay dry.</p>

                        <p>Its important that modules do not take too much time to run as this will cause load issues on
                            the PI.</p>

                            <p>After AllSky has taken an image the save image process is run in background, including
                                running the relevant module flow. Its important that this process finishes before the
                                next image is captured. If the module flow takes too long multiple save image process
                                will be running, this will start to cause performance issues on the PI</p>
                            <p>The best way to ensure this does not happen is to make sure that the module watchdog is
                                enabled in the Module Manager Settings</p>
                            <blockquote><strong>TIP</strong> - When installing a new module ensure debug mode is enabled
                                in the Module Manager Settings and monitor how long the new module is taking and what
                                effect its having on the overall flow time</blockquote>

                    <div>
                        <p>The module system is designed to be extended by developing custom modules</p>

                            <h3>Python Versions</h3>
                            <p>Modules are developed in <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> and
                                should use the latest version available for the Pi. Its should be noted that whilst
                                multiple versions of Python can be installed on a Pi its best just to use the version
                                that ships with the OS. Generally that may mean reinstalling your AllSky installation to
                                get the latest version of python. Running multiple versions of python is beyond the
                                scope of this documentation </p>
                            <h3>Anatomy Of A Module</h3>
                            <p>A module consists of two key parts</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>The metadata variable</strong> - This variable defines everything the module
                                    manager needs to run the module. This includes basic information about the module
                                    and the configuration options it requires</li>
                                <li><strong>The module entry point</strong> - The main function that is called by the
                                    Module Manager</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Every module MUST import the allsky_shared module. This module is used to pass data from
                                the flow processor to each module</p>

                            <h4>The Meta Data Variable</h4>
                            <blockquote>Please refer to the BoilerPlate example module for more details of the variable.
                                The Boiler Plate example includes all of the available options</blockquote>

                                then a settings option will be displayed in the module manager. Clicking on the settings
                                option will display a dialog allowing the modules settings to be changed. The dialog is
                                created automatically from the options defined in the argumentdetails section</p>

                            <p>To improve the performance of modules a common shared module is used. This shared module
                                allsky_shared contains both helper functions and data from the main capture process. The
                                module exists so that each individual module does not have to perform length taks like
                                loading an image</p>
