A <b>startrails</b> is an image that contains all the images from a night on top of each other,
so show the movement of stars.
<blockquote>
Only nighttime images that are saved are included in a startrails,
so if you don't save your nightime images, they won't be included.
</blockquote>

<h2>Creating a startrails image</h2>
<p>
You specify whether or not you want a startrails image automatically created via the
<a allsky="true" external="true" href="/documentation/settings/allsky.html#startrails">
	<span class="WebUISetting">Generate</span></a>
setting in the <span class="subSettingsHeader">Startrails</span> sub-section of the WebUI.
When enabled, a startrails will be created at the end of night.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to create and optionally upload a startrails is via the
<code>generateForDay.sh</code> command.
For example, to create and then upload a startrails to any Allsky Website and/or remote server 
you have for July 10, 2024:
<pre>
generateForDay.sh --startrails 20240710
generateForDay.sh --upload --startrails 20240710
</pre>
This will use the settings specified in the
<span class="subSettingsHeader">Startrails</span> sub-section of the WebUI.
</p>
<p>
<code>generateForDay.sh</code> calls the <code>startrails</code> program
to actually create the startrails, passing it several arguments
(the <u>underlined</u> ones below),
plus any others you add to the 
<span class="WebUISetting">Startrails Extra Parameters</span> setting.
</p>
<p>
You can execute the <code>startrails</code> program manually,
but will need to specify at least all the required arguments.
</p>

<pre>
Usage: startrails [-v] -d &lt;dir&gt; -e &lt;ext&gt; [-b &lt;brightness&gt;] [-o &lt;output&gt;] [-S] [-s &lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;]

Arguments:
-h : display this help, then exit
-v : increase log verbosity
-S : print image directory statistics without producing image.
<u>-d &lt;str&gt; : directory from which to read images (required)</u>
<u>-e &lt;str&gt; : filter images to just this extension (required)</u>
<u>-o &lt;str&gt; : output image filename</u>
-s &lt;int&gt;x&lt;int&gt; : restrict processed images to this size
<u>-b &lt;float&gt; : ranges from 0 (black) to 1 (white).</u>
        A moonless sky may be as low as 0.05 while full moon can be as high as 0.4.
</pre>

<br><p>
Example of running the <code>startrails</code> program manually:
<pre>
cd ~/allsky/bin
./startrails -d images/20240710 -e jpg -b 0.15 -o images/20240710/startrails/startrails.jpg
</pre>
</p>

<!-- THESE SETTINGS NO LONGER EXIST
<blockquote>
<b>Tip</b>: If you set the
<span class="WebUISetting">Image Width</span>
and
<span class="WebUISetting">Image Height</span>
of your camera in the WebUI <span class="WebUIWebPage">Allsky Settings</span>
page to the actual values of your camera,
startrails generation will skip any file that's not the correct size.
This will eliminate any garbage images that happen to be generated.
</blockquote>
-->

<h2 id="brightnessThreshold"><span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span></h2>
<p>
The only configuration setting for startrails is
<span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span> which defaults to
<span class="WebUIValue">0.1</span>.
Any image with an average brightness greater than this will
be skipped during startrails image generation,
so <b>almost all daytime images are skipped</b>.
You need to experiment with this to get the best results,
as allsky cameras, lenses, and sky brightnesses impact this setting.
</p>
<p>
If your startrails aren't working and you get a message
<b>No images below threshold 0.100, writing the minimum image only</b>,
this means all your images are too bright.
If startrails previously worked, did you recently update the
<span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span> setting?
If so, set it back to what it used to be.
</p>
<p>
To determine what to use for the
<span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>,
you need to know the typical <b>nighttime</b> sky brightness values.
Do the following (replace "DATE" below with the date of a non-working startrails):
<ol>
	<li>Create a temporary directory to hold nighttime images:
		<code>mkdir ~/allsky/images/test</code>.
	<li><code>cd ~/allsky/images/DATE</code>.
	<li>Using the time of each image, move a few hours of <b>nighttime</b> images to
		<span class="fileName">allsky/images/test</span>.
		This is easiest if you first open a "File Manager" window on the Pi -
		you can then select the files with the mouse and
		drag to the <span class="fileName">test</span> directory.
		<br>If you aren't logged into the Pi desktop you'll need to use
		the <code>mv</code> command to move the files.
		Using the <code>*</code> wildcard in the file names will allow you to move
		multiple files at a time.
	<li>Run <code>generateForDay.sh --startrails test</code>
		to create a startrails file in the <span class="fileName">test</span> directory.
		It should say <b>No images below...</b>.
	<li>Look at the output line showing the minimum and maximum.
		Set the <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>
		to the <strong>maximum</strong>, or slightly below it.
	<li>Run <code>generateForDay.sh --startrails test</code>
		to create a new startrails - it should give a decent result.
	<li>Adjust <span class="WebUISetting">Brightness Threshold</span>
		and re-run <code>generateForDay.sh</code> as needed.
	<li>When done move all the images in <span class="fileName">allsky/images/test</span>
		back to <span class="fileName">allsky/images/DATE</span>.
	<li>Remove the temporary directory: <code>rm -fr ~/allsky/images/test</code>.
	<li>Now, create the final startrails:
		<ul class="minimalPadding topPadding">
			<li><code>generateForDay.sh --startrails DATE</code>
			<li>If you want to upload the <span class="fileName">startrails.jpg</span>
				file you just created, see the note generated by <code>generateForDay.sh</code>.
		</ul>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
If a startrails isn't being created, make sure the
<span class="WebUISetting">Generate</span> setting is enabled.
If that IS enabled, run:
<pre>generateForDay.sh --startrails DATE</pre>
and check for errors.
<blockquote>
It is extremely rare that a startrails isn't created at all.
It's much more common that only 1 image is used -
in that case, see the <a href="#brightnessThreshold">Brightness Threshold</a> section above.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
If a startrails isn't being uploaded, make sure the
<span class="WebUISetting">Upload</span> setting is enabled.
If that IS enabled, run:
<pre>generateForDay.sh --upload --debug --startrails DATE</pre>
and check for errors.
If needed, run <code>testUpload.sh</code> to see why the upload fails.
