<p>
The code for the Allsky Website is installed as part of the Allsky installation on your Pi,
so no installation is necessary on the Pi,
although it needs to be configured before it can be used.
Make sure you have Allsky configured and working the way you want it before
configuring a Website since some of the Allsky settings are also used by the Website
and you don't want to have to change them twice.
</p>

<p>
If you have an <b>existing</b> Allsky Website on your Pi,
the installation of Allsky will move images and videos from the prior Website's directory
to the new Website's directory.
If the prior Website was version <b>v2022.03.01+</b> or earlier you need to:
<ol>
	<li><em>Manually</em> copy your prior settings from 
		<span class="fileName">/var/www/html/allsky/config.js</span> to
		<span class="fileName">configuration.json</span> by going to the 
		<span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> page in the WebUI and selecting
		<code>configuration.json (local Allsky Website)</code>.
		Note that there are more settings in the new configuration file,
		but it should be straightforward to map settings from the old file to the new file.
	<li>After configuring the local Website,
		check in <span class="fileName">/var/www/html/allsky</span>
		for any files you manually added and store them in
		<span class="fileName">~/allsky/html/allsky/myFiles</span>.
	<li>Save <span class="fileName">config.js</span> somewhere in case you need it later.
	<li>Remove the old Website: <pre> rm -fr /var/www/html/allsky </pre>
</ol>
</p>



<h2>Install a remote Allsky Website</h2>
<p>
Most people have their Pi behind a firewall where it's not accessible on the Internet,
so they install the Allsky Website on a different
machine that <u>is</u> accessible on the Internet.
<!--
<blockquote>
If you want to make your Pi available on the Internet, see
<a external="true" href="https://medium.com/swlh/host-a-raspberry-pi-web-server-on-the-internet-89786287db77">these instructions</a>.
<br>
<strong>Be careful if you do this - if done incorrectly your Pi may be insecure.</strong>
</blockquote>
-->
</p>
<p>
Prior to installing the Website on a remote server,
make sure Allsky is working on your Pi, then do the following:
<ol>
	<li>On the remote server:
		<ul>
			<li>Create an <span class="fileName">allsky</span>
				directory to hold the Website.
				<strong>Keep track of where on your server you created the directory</strong>
				- you will need that information later when you tell Allsky
				where to upload the images.
		</ul>
	<li>On the Pi:
		<ol type="A">
		<li>Copy ALL files and directories in
			<span class="fileName">~/allsky/html/allsky</span>
			to the <span class="fileName">allsky</span>
			directory on your remote Website.
			<br>Do this using whatever procedure you use to copy other files there.
		<li>Go to the <span class="settingsHeader">Websites and Remote Server Settings</span>
			section in the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Allsky Settings</span> page.
			Update the settings in the
			<span class="subSettingsHeader">Remote Website</span> subsection.
			Make sure to enable <span class="WebUISetting">Use Remote Website</span>
			as well as enough other settings so Allsky can upload a file to the Website.
		<li>Run <code>cd ~/allsky;  ./remoteWebsiteInstall.sh</code>
			to upload a default configuration file to your server,
			leaving the master copy on the Pi.
			<ul>
			<li>If the upload fails, see the
				<a allsky="true" href="../troubleshooting/uploads.html">Troubleshooting uploads</a>
				page on how to debug the problem.
			<li>If you previously enabled the <u>local</u> Allsky Website,
				the remote configuration file will be identical to the local one with the
				exception of the <span class="editorSetting">imageName</span> setting
				which will be configured for the remote Website.
				<br>
				If you want the remote configuration to differ from the local one
				(for example, to add a background image to the remote Website),
				edit the remote configuration file - see the next step.
			</ul>
		<li>Configure the remote Website:
			<ul class="minimalPadding">
				<li>In the WebUI, click on the <span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> link.
				<li>In the drop-down at the bottom of the page, select
					<code class="noWrap">remote_configuration.json (remote Allsky Website).</code>
				<li>See the
					<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/settings/allskyWebsite.html">
					Settings -> Allsky Website</a>
					page for details on the settings.
				<li>A copy of the remote Website configuration
					file will be uploaded to the server.
			</ul>
			<blockquote class="warning">
			Whenever you update the remote Website's configuration you <strong>must</strong>
			do so via WebUI following the steps above.
			Do NOT edit the configuration file directly on the remote server.
			</blockquote>
		</ol>
	<li>Your remote server is now ready.
	<li>Give your family and friends the URL to your Allsky Website so they can enjoy your images!
</ol>


<h4>Remote Website Requirements</h4>
The remote server needs to support the following:
<ul class="minimalPadding">
	<li>PHP version 7 or newer.
	<li>The <code>imagecreatefromjpeg</code> function in PHP to create thumbnails
		of the startrails and keogram files.
		If that function does not exist (which is rare),
		you'll see a thumbnail that says "No thumbnail".
		Everything else will still work.
	<li>The <code>ffmpeg</code> command and <code>exec</code> function in PHP
		to create thumbnails of the timelapse videos.
		<blockquote>
		Most hosting solutions don't support those commands for security reasons.
		In that case, make sure <span class="WebUISetting">Upload Timelapse Thumbnail</span>
		is enabled (and <span class="WebUISetting">Upload Mini-Timelapse Thumbnail</span>
		if you are creating mini timelapses).
		Failure to set those variables will result in "No thumbnail" messages when
		viewing videos.
		Everything else will still work.
		</blockquote>
</ul>


<h2>Post installation</h2>
<p>
Change
<a allsky="true" href="/documentation/settings/allskyWebsite.html">Allsky Website Settings</a>
as desired so the Website looks and behaves like you want.
Changes to both local Websites and remote Websites are done via the WebUI.
</p>

<blockquote>
If you have both a local and a remote Website,
they each have their own configuration file which is
accessible via the WebUI's <span class="WebUIWebPage">Editor</span> page.
They are NOT automatically kept in sync so if you change something, for example,
the lens, you'll need to change it in both files.
