<h2>Allsky Software</h2>
The GitHub <a href="https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky"><code>allsky</code></a>
software consists of two main parts which are both
included when installing or upgrading Allsky,
as well as optional modules.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Allsky</strong>
		is the main program that captures and saves images
		and includes the Web User Interface (<b>WebUI</b>)
		used to administer Allsky and parts of your Pi.
		You can also:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
			<li>Display the most recent image, called a <b>Liveview</b>.
			<li>View all saved prior images, timelapse, keograms, and startrails.
			<li>Configure Allsky settings via the WebUI and a built-in color text editor.
			<li>See the status of the LAN and WLAN (Wireless LAN).
			<li>Configure Wi-Fi.
			<li>View information about the Pi such as amount of free disk space,
				CPU temperature, etc.
			<li>Optionally view user-generated data such as ambient temperature or fan speed.
			<li>View Allsky Documentation, of which this page is part of.
		</ul>

	<li><strong>Allsky Website</strong> is a simple web interface that
		can run on your Pi and/or a remote server and displays:
		<ul class="minimalPadding">
			<li>The most recent image.
			<li>An optional constellation overlay on the image.
			<li>Saved startrails, keograms, and/or timelapse videos.
			<li>Optionally the most recent "mini" timelapse video.
			<li>Information about your camera like location, owner,
				Pi version, camera type, etc.
			<li>Optional information about your settings.
		</ul>
	<li>The GitHub
		<a href="https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky-modules"><code>user-modules</code></a>
		repository contains additional, user-developed
		modules that can be used with Allsky.
		See the
		<a allsky="true" external="true" href="../modules/modules.html">Modules page</a>
		for more information.
</ol>

<h2>Terms</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <b>WebUI</b> is the Web User Interface used to administer Allsky.
<li>When a page says "Allsky Software" or just "software" it's referring to
	the main Allsky software that's running on your Pi and resides in the
	<span class="fileName">~/allsky</span> directory.
<li>A <b>server</b>, as in "remote server", is a computer that often sits
	in a datacenter and has a dedicated purpose such as hosting web pages or returning
	search results (e.g., Google).
	Most servers run Windows or Linux, but Allsky doesn't care.
<li>The term <b>Allsky Website</b> is often shortened to <b>Website</b> with a capital <b>W</b>.
<li>A <b>local</b> Allsky Website runs on the same Pi as Allsky runs on.
	<br>A <b>remote</b> Website runs somewhere else.
	Allsky doesn't care if the remote machine is a true "server" or
	simply a 10-year old PC sitting under your desk.
	The Allsky documentation considers both of them a "remote server".
</ul>


<h2>Documentation Conventions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Commands that are to be executed on the Pi
		look like this: <code>systemctl start allsky</code>.
		When multiple commands are to be executed they are usually displayed like this
		and can typically be copied from the documenation and pasted into a Pi terminal window:
<pre>
systemctl start allsky
date
</pre>

	<li>File names are shown as: <span class="fileName">configuration.json</span>.
	<li>Links on the WebUI to its various pages are shown as:
		<span class="WebUILink">Editor</span>.
	<li>Settings in the WebUI appear as: <span class="WebUISetting">Debug Level</span>.
</ul>
