<p>
This page is for people with little or no Pi experience.
To keep the other Allsky documentation pages a manageable length,
they assume you have basic Pi knowledge.
For example, you know how to turn a Pi on and off and how to connect a camera to it.
</p>

<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
<p>
The Linux operating system controls the Pi's hardware and lets you run software
such as Allsky.
Just like Windows and MacOS, there are multiple versions of
the Pi's operating system (called "Pi OS"),
and support for old versions is eventually dropped.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bookworm</b> is the current Pi OS
and is what you should run (use the 64-bit version if you can).
Allsky runs on the older <b>Bullseye</b> and <b>Buster</b>
operating systems but this is the last version of Allsky
that will run on <b>Buster</b>.
</p>
<p>
There are different distributions of Linux (called "distros") from various companies.
While they are basically the same Linux,
there can be subtle differences and the administrative commands can vary.
</p>
<blockquote class="warning">
Allsky only supports the <b>Debian</b> distro.
</blockquote>


<h2>Raspberry Pi Models</h2>
<p>
There are several models of the Pi including Zero, Zero 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and others.
The Pi 3 and 4 are the most common being used for Allsky,
but some people have the Pi Zero or Zero 2 because of their low cost.
The various models have different processing power;
the Pi 5 is the most powerful, followed by the 4, then 3, then 2, then 1.
The Zero 2 is near the Pi 3 in terms of processing power but has less memory.
The Pi 4 is available with up to 8 GB memory whereas the
Pi Zero and Zero 2 are limited to 0.5 GB memory.
</p>
<blockquote class="warning">
Allsky runs on the Zero 2, but just barely.
The processing power of the Pi Zero is very limited so you likely won't
be able to create timelapse videos - stay away from it if possible.
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>The recommended unit is a Pi 4 or 5 with 4 GB or more of memory.</strong>
Allsky runs nicely on them and the USB 3.0 ports are nice for cameras that support it.
